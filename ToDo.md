# To Do List

### Python Script:

### Prompt Engineering:
- Try to get Truth and Confidence levels more accurate
- Try new prompt ideas to increase dissinformation detection accuracy

### Other:
- Figure out how to use Liar Dataset's non-binary form of dissinformation labeling
- Find additional datasets

### Website:
- Have prompt text input box resize to fit user's input as they type (Jordan)
- Include in email number of false positives and negatives and true positives and negatives (include all data from the xcel testing sheet) (try and include it as a table similar to the table in xcel testing sheet) Also include percentages (Mitchell)
- Include in email these statistics (ie precision and recall and fscore): https://blog.nillsf.com/index.php/2020/05/23/confusion-matrix-accuracy-recall-precision-false-positive-rate-and-f-scores-explained/ (Mitchell)
- Include the url if people have questions about the statistics (also include a description of what the statistics mean): https://blog.nillsf.com/index.php/2020/05/23/confusion-matrix-accuracy-recall-precision-false-positive-rate-and-f-scores-explained/ (Mitchell)
- Make WebDetect.py add the user's prompt on to the main prompt (the prompt that explains the correct formatting to the AI, seperated by semicolons and what not) (see detect.py for example format prompt)
