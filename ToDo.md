# To Do List

### Python Script:

### Prompt Engineering:
- Try to get Truth and Confidence levels more accurate
- Try new prompt ideas to increase dissinformation detection accuracy

### Other:
- Figure out how to use Liar Dataset's non-binary form of dissinformation labeling
- Find additional datasets

### Website:
- Fix email capabilities
- Make page for testing API key
- Has a field where user can input how many rows they want the prompt to test (default is 300, max is 500)
- Have detect.py pull random rows to test instead of the first 300 every time
- Have an input field for user's API key and have detect.py use that API key
- Have prompt text input box resize to fit user's input as they type
- Include in email number of false positives and negatives and true positives and negatives (include all data from the xcel testing sheet) (try and include it as a table similar to the table in xcel testing sheet) Also include percentages
- Include in email these statistics (ie precision and recall and fscore): https://blog.nillsf.com/index.php/2020/05/23/confusion-matrix-accuracy-recall-precision-false-positive-rate-and-f-scores-explained/
- Include the url if people have questions about the statistics (also include a description of what the statistics mean): https://blog.nillsf.com/index.php/2020/05/23/confusion-matrix-accuracy-recall-precision-false-positive-rate-and-f-scores-explained/
