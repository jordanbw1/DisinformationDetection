While it is true that the number of African American and Hispanic students attending Florida's public universities increased after the state banned affirmative action in admissions in 1999, this increase was largely due to demographic changes and not because of the elimination of affirmative action. In fact, studies have shown that the elimination of affirmative action has had a negative impact on the enrollment of African American and Hispanic students at Florida's public universities. For example, a study by the University of Florida found that the number of African American students enrolled at the university declined by 10% after the state banned affirmative action."

This means that Georgia taxpayers paid $3.3 billion more in federal transportation taxes than they received in federal transportation funding. Additionally, Georgia has a number of regulations that make it more expensive to build and maintain transportation infrastructure, which also contributes to the state's high transportation costs. I am confident in my answer because it is supported by data from the Tax Foundation and the Georgia Department of Transportation. However, I am not giving it a perfect score of 10 because there may be some nuances or exceptions to the general trend that I am not aware of."

There is overwhelming evidence that the Earth is an oblate spheroid, meaning it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator. This evidence includes:

* **Observations of the Earth from space:** Photographs and videos taken from space clearly show that the Earth is round.
* **Measurements of the Earth's circumference:** Scientists have measured the Earth's circumference in a variety of ways, and all of these measurements have confirmed that the Earth is round.
* **The Earth's shadow on the moon:** During a lunar eclipse, the Earth's shadow on the moon is always round. This would not be the case if the Earth were flat.
* **The Coriolis effect:** The Coriolis effect is a force that deflects objects moving in the Earth's atmosphere or oceans. This force is caused by the Earth's rotation, and it would not exist if the Earth were flat.

The claim that the Earth is flat is a conspiracy theory that has been repeatedly debunked by scientists. There is no credible evidence to support this claim."

A study by the Center for Responsive Politics found that in the 2020 election cycle, representatives who voted to keep militarizing the police received an average of $10,000 more in campaign contributions from the defense industry than those who voted to stop it.

The report's findings have been widely reported in the media and have not been disputed by the companies involved.

Section 4 - A explanation of why the post is fact or fake and why you gave the confidence level you did. Here is the twitter post: ",Fake,Fact, 9, 7,0," The post is factual because it is based on a study by the New York Times that found that if Trump had invested his father's money in a mutual fund, he would have $8 billion today. The study used data from Forbes magazine to estimate the value of Trump's father's estate in 1974, and then used historical data on the performance of the S&P 500 index to calculate how much the money would have grown if it had been invested in a mutual fund. The study found that Trump's father's estate would have grown to $8 billion by 2018, even after accounting for inflation. The confidence level is high because the study was conducted by a reputable news organization and the methodology is sound. The truthfulness of the post is somewhat lower because it is based on a hypothetical scenario, and it is possible that Trump would have made different investment decisions if he had actually inherited his father's money."
