0,WELFake Dataset,"Conservative and liberal advocacy groups are gearing up for a ferocious political brawl over President Obama’s pick to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the weekend death of Justice Antonin Scalia, and already the battle is spilling from the presidential campaign into some of the nation’s most hotly contested Senate races.

White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz repeated Monday that the president intends to “fulfill his constitutional responsibility” by nominating a new justice and predicted that Senate Republicans, despite their current loud opposition, will ultimately hold a confirmation hearing and vote for the nominee.

“This is not the first time the Republicans have come out with a lot of bluster only to have reality sink in,” Schultz said. “We need a fully staffed Supreme Court.”

Schultz quoted President Ronald Reagan, who pressed for a vote on his Supreme Court nominee Anthony M. Kennedy, who was confirmed in 1988: “Every day that passes with a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people’s business in that crucially important body.”

But across the board, Republicans have argued that Obama should allow his successor to make the pick and that they would block any attempt to confirm a new justice this year.

[Why blocking Obama’s pick could cost Republicans the Senate]

One consideration that may force Republicans to recalibrate their strategy is the prospect of political damage to some of the embattled Senate incumbents up for reelection this fall. Sens. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.), Ron Johnson (Wis.) and Rob Portman (Ohio), all Republicans in swing states, have called for the Senate to disregard any Obama nominee. Other Republicans in tight races have remained silent so far.

Democrats see a potential confirmation battle as an opportunity to put Republicans on the defensive and as a wedge issue that could help them retake control of the Senate. In Ohio, former Democratic governor Ted Strickland, who is vying for his party’s nomination to challenge Portman, said Monday that by opposing an Obama nominee, Portman was “failing to do his job, shirking his responsibilities to our nation, jeopardizing the institutions of our democracy and engaging in exactly the kind of dysfunctional behavior that frustrates Ohioans about Congress.”

P.G. Sittenfeld, a Cincinnati City Council member running against Strickland in the Democratic primary, declared Monday that Portman was advocating actions that would “put the Senate in violation of both historical precedent and the clear language of the Constitution itself.”

Portman responded in a statement Monday that the next president should choose Scalia’s replacement: “With the election less than nine months away, I believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations,” he said.

Conservative activists are drawing up plans to mobilize support and pressure lawmakers to reject any nominee.

FreedomWorks, a group that pledges to promote “smaller government, lower taxes, free markets, personal liberty and the rule of law,” said it would wage a grass-roots campaign to oppose Democrats who would “ram liberal judicial nominees through the Senate . . . occasionally with the help of unprincipled, big government Republicans.”

Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director for the Judicial Crisis Network and a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, said conservatives are still mourning Scalia. But, she added, “if the president tries to pack the court, as it is apparent he may, then JCN will be leading the charge to delay a Senate vote until the American people decide the next president.”

Liberal groups are working hard to undercut the prevailing Republican argument that it is inappropriate for Obama to nominate a Supreme Court justice at this late stage of his presidency.

Americans United for Change, a group closely allied with the White House, is trumpeting an article written by now-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in 1970. McConnell wrote that “the Senate should discount the philosophy of the nominee” and that “the president is presumably elected by the people to carry out a program and altering the ideological direction of the Supreme Court would seem to be a perfectly legitimate part of a presidential platform.”

Nan Aron, president of the Alliance for Justice, said the sudden Supreme Court vacancy has mobilized progressive groups and broadened the coalition usually assembled for nomination fights.

“What’s unusual about this moment, and this effort, is that the community as a whole is coming together,” said Aron, whose group focuses on federal judicial nominations. “In addition to organizations focused on judicial selections, others that aren’t realize what’s at stake and are weighing in already.”

MoveOn.org and CREDO Action, liberal advocacy groups, have launched petitions calling on the Senate to fill Scalia’s seat. As of Monday evening, each petition had garnered more than 100,000 signatures.

People close to the administration expect that Obama’s choice this time will resemble his earlier ones.

“I think the best way to think about who the president might appoint is to look at who he has appointed,” said Caroline Fredrickson, president of the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy. “He has picked people who are qualified beyond question and with an eye toward making the court more diverse. I think those will be the main touchstones.”

A person close to the administration, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect those relationships, said the pick is likely to be someone “super-qualified” who had been confirmed by overwhelming majorities of currently sitting Republicans; that would make it difficult for the GOP to argue that the nominee is unqualified.

Meanwhile, a wall of silence went up Monday around Scalia’s final hours and the confusion after his death. Local officials in rural West Texas, where he died, spent hours trying to locate a justice of peace after his body was discovered. The justice who was eventually found, Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara, pronounced Scalia dead without seeing his body — which is permissible under Texas law — and declined to order an autopsy. A second justice has said that one should have been performed.

Scalia’s family opposed an autopsy, and Guevara said Sunday that she determined by telephone that Scalia died of natural causes because he was having “health issues.’’ She cited information from federal officials at the scene and a conversation she had with Scalia’s physician. She said she was awaiting a statement from the physician to complete the death certificate.

Scalia’s physician, Brian Monahan, declined to divulge any details about Scalia’s health when reached by telephone at his home in Maryland on Monday. “Patient confidentiality forbids me to make any comment on the subject,’’ he said, before hanging up.

As we kick off the third week of trading in November, today James Turk spoke with King World News about why what Donald Trump faces is very different from what Ronald Reagan face, but here is the good news… 
James Turk: “ Congratulations to Mr Trump. If his presidency is as remarkable as his election, Eric, he could go down in history as a great president. I expect that a lot of things will change because of Trump. That’s what voters want… Sponsored 
I’ve seen polls showing that 70% or more of the electorate believes the country is headed in the wrong direction. A result like that cuts across party lines. 
The last time I felt like this about the potential for major systemic change was when Reagan became president in 1981. Coincidentally, a lot of people back then were shocked that Reagan would be president, just like the shock we are seeing today with Trump’s victory. I hope that with his performance that Trump confounds his cynics just like Reagan did. 
With Reagan the coming systemic changes were pretty obvious because Paul Volcker had already been appointed as Fed chairman and had unsettled the markets by increasing interest rates. That signaled a major inflationary cycle was ending. 
The Reagan presidency began a new disinflationary cycle, which lasted until Bush No. 2 took office. Annual increases in monetary debasement once again became measurable, and the gold price began rising in response. 
I am not convinced at this time that we are at the end of any cycle, but I nevertheless expect circumstances will indeed be different going forward. My thinking is that the present cycle of monetary debasement is not going to end or even just abate as occurred with Reagan. 
The change I expect is the trend of purchasing power erosion will accelerate. Trump of course could change that trend. He is so far making the right statements. Lower taxes and less regulation will indeed improve the economy. A stronger economy will increase tax revenues, which will be needed to fund the infrastructure spending that Trump is promising. 
But so far he seems to be ignoring a key issue. The federal government’s debt has become so big it is now unmanageable. To illustrate my point, let’s take Trump at his word that he is going to control government spending so it doesn’t increase the deficit, even though he is going to increase spending for defense and infrastructure. Let’s assume that the increased spending in these two areas is covered by higher tax revenue from economic growth, and is therefore neutral to the deficit. 
But what if interest rates rise to a more normal 5% as some are predicting? 
Let’s assume Mr Trump saves money by completely eliminating the Departments of Commerce, Education, Housing and Labor. Then he also eliminates the Environmental Protection Agency, and throws in some other savings by completely eliminating International Assistance Programs, NASA and the National Science Foundation. 
Add it all up and Trump saves about $200 billion each year. That’s about equal to the additional annual interest expense on the $20 trillion federal government debt if rates rise 1%. So if interest rates rise to 5%, the federal deficits are going to soar. To fund those deficits, the Federal Reserve is going to have to do a lot of money printing, which of course will debase the dollar by eroding its purchasing power. 
The important point is that if the Fed hikes rates, then rising interest rates will   borrow even more just to pay interest on its debt, which creates a vicious cycle that will ultimately destroy the dollar. But if interest rates stay low, the Fed destroys savers and capitalism because it is eliminating the incentive to save any national currency, which lowers the demand for that currency and in this way too the Fed ultimately destroys the dollar. 
So in either scenario, the dollar is toast, but there is a solution…This will be continued tomorrow in part two of James Turk’s powerful interview. In the meantime, for those who are interested in hearing more about the gold market and the Trump shocker, KWN has just released   gold,   more. and you can listen to this extraordinary interview   Legend Art Cashin On A Trump Presidency, The New World Order, Gold, Brexit, The Great Depression And Why We Will See Panic  ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"As soon as I walked into Celia Rojas’s prekindergarten class in Union City, N. J. I was sucked in by the hum of activity. Art plastered the walls, plants were hanging from the ceiling, and in every nook there was something to seize a child’s imagination. Some kids were doing cutouts of paper clothing and others were at an easel, painting. A bunch of children were solving puzzles on a computer, while another group was building a pink cardboard chair, which they called “A Chair for My Mother. ” In the reading nook a girl was learning about how, when the wasp larva hatches, it eats the spider. Three classmates were playing   trying on old felt hats and checking themselves out in the mirror. The teacher was everywhere  —   praising kids, offering suggestions when they were stumped and, sometimes, peacemaking. Two boys were peering at insects through a microscope when they started fighting over who got to look next. Ms. Rojas deftly diverted them. “How many parts does an insect body have?” she asked. The boys knew: “Three parts  —   the antenna, abdomen and legs. ” “How about an insect salad  —   would you want to eat it?” she inquired. “Ugh,” the boys chorused. “Why not  —   are they bad for you?” she asked. The boys thought about it. “Maybe if you chopped them up they’d be O. K.,” one volunteered. At that moment I wished that I were 4 years old and could join the festivities. But most   classrooms look entirely different. After surveying preschools nationwide, Robert Pianta, dean of the University of Virginia Curry School of Education, concluded that “superficial task demands, including giving directions and assigning routine tasks, predominate over children’s involvement in appropriate conceptual or   activities. ” A preschool in Chicago that I visited a few years earlier boasted that it was certified by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, the   equivalent of the Good Housekeeping seal. But it didn’t merit that encomium. A big room that might once have been a storeroom had been split into   each about 15 feet square, separated by   partitions. Noise reverberated throughout the building. “Stay within the lines,” a teacher commanded a    boy. “You’re not tracing the triangle. ” After he started coloring, she returned, exasperated. “You weren’t paying attention during circle time. Only color the triangles, not the circle or the heart. ” The teacher turned to me. “I like the kids when they stay within the lines and color beautiful,” she said. In another class, children were told to paint the bottom section of a pyramid. The directions were the same: Stay within the lines. It turned out that the kids were painting the food pyramid, but they didn’t know that’s what they were doing. What I saw made me wish that I could round up a passel of children and make a run for safety. Deborah Stipek, a professor of education at Stanford, makes the point more bluntly: “What I see in a lot of preschools is much worse than coloring between the lines. It’s teachers yelling at kids all day. ” These two prekindergartens serve very different populations, but perhaps not the ones you might expect. The “stay within the lines”   enrolls mainly   youngsters, whose parents pay to send them there, while Ms. Rojas’s classroom is in a public school in a poor immigrant community. Though I’ve spent many hours crouching in these classrooms, I’m no expert. What I witnessed should be obvious to any mom or dad. That’s why, even if you are an   parent, you can rapidly determine whether you want to send your child to a particular preschool. You may also be able to save a boatload of money, since public preschools are often as good as their $30, 000 alternatives. When you walk in the door of a prekindergarten, check out the walls  —   they should be festooned with children’s projects, and not, as is too often the case, plastered with posters that are calculated to please adults and mounted too high for    to see. Look around. There should be lots of different things for children to do. If the kids say hello, and quickly return to what they have been doing, that’s a good sign, for it suggests that they’re developing social skills. But if they mob you, you have your answer: This isn’t the place for your child. You might consider yourself to be a fascinating person, but you shouldn’t be more interesting than whatever activity these   and    are engaged in. Is the class   silent? I’ve talked with    parents who equate obedience with quality, but unless you want your child in boot camp, that’s unhealthy. (Of course, running wild isn’t a good thing either that   energy belongs on the playground.) Kids should be quiet, if a bit squirmy, during circle time, when they are gathered around their teacher. But mostly they should be engaged with one another, because that’s when most learning occurs. Their teacher should be talking with them, not at them. And if the classroom looks like a healthy mix of kids from different backgrounds, that’s all to the good. Children learn a lot from their classmates, and kids with different experiences have much to contribute to one another. That’s it, more or less. If you have a chance to talk briefly with the teacher, ask her how she decides to spend time with one group or another. Inquire about how she handles children who haven’t fully learned how, as the argot goes, to use their words, take turns or share. While the answer matters, you mostly want to make sure she has really thought about those things. Winging it doesn’t make for good teaching. I imagine many readers believe that I’ve committed heresy. To them, Montessori or HighScope, Reggio Emilia or Waldorf, or some other school of   pedagogy embodies the Holy Grail. But there’s no reason to believe that one of these is better than the others. The key is how well a particular model of teaching is being carried out. A class can be a joy when the teacher truly understands how properly to use, say, the HighScope approach, which has the children decide what they want to do that day, then tackle the chosen project and later review what they’ve learned. But these techniques are devilishly hard to pull off. When done badly the result is a mighty mess. That’s why the school district in the first example allows the best teachers to design a curriculum that, while borrowing from   approaches, makes the most sense for their kids. For parents, the bottom line is simple: Watch closely what’s happening in the classroom, pick a preschool that you wish you had gone to, and your child will do just fine.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s campaign traded barbs with mayoral challenger (and fellow Democrat) Mitchell Schwartz last week over the city’s    rising violent crime rate. [During a Northridge East Neighborhood Council candidate forum, Schwartz accused Garcetti of concealing rising crime statistics by not holding an annual news conference on them at the end of the year, according to the Los Angeles Daily News. Garcetti spokesman Yusef Robb slammed Schwartz’s “conspiracy theory” as he tried to explain away the lack of news conference as a scheduling matter. He went on to claim that L. A. crime is at “historic lows” and blamed the state for failures associated with prison sentence reductions under 2014’s Proposition 47.  Violent crime in Los Angeles was up 10 percent in 2016 from 2015, according to the Daily News, which noted that the crime statistics were quietly rolled out on the police department’s website. In prior years the statistics were announced jointly and very publicly by the mayor and chief of police. Schwartz has been campaigning on his goal to add 2, 500 police officers to the city’s police department, according to the report. Another mayoral challenger, Paul Amori, piled on the criticism of Garcetti, saying that “crime is up massively” under Garcetti’s watch, though he didn’t blame Garcetti alone. This week, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer highlighted San Diego’s    decrease in violent crime while noting in a statement that violent crime in Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Antonio and Dallas had higher rates. In January, Garcetti spent several days fundraising in Chicago, Washington D. C and New York for his   bid. Earlier the same month, former Vice President Joe Biden appeared at a fundraiser for Garcetti in Beverly Hills. In early February, Garcetti took time to appear on MSNBC, stating that if Los Angeles police were enforcing immigration law, they couldn’t be out solving crimes. Garcetti has repeatedly criticized President Donald Trump’s plans to enforce immigration law and warnings that sanctuary cities face losing federal dollars. Aides to Garcetti said that on March 3 Garcetti and Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck will roll out a “public safety initiative. ” Garcetti has also been the target of protests by Black Lives Matter activists, who President Trump and other critics have blamed for making the tasks facing police in inner cities more difficult.

0,WELFake Dataset,"EAST CHICAGO, Ind. (Reuters) - The head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) toured his first hazardous waste site on Tuesday amid proposed budget cuts that could devastate efforts to clean up contaminated land and water around the country.  Scott Pruitt’s visit to East Chicago, Indiana, came a day after the agency denied a report that it was considering closing its Chicago office, which oversees regional environmental protection efforts, including the Flint, Michigan drinking water clean-up and Great Lakes restoration. “The reason I’m here is because it is important that we restore confidence to the people here in this community that we are going to get it right going forward,” Pruitt told the media after meeting with residents and lawmakers.  Pruitt did not address the report of the possible office closure or how drastic budget cuts would impact the EPA’s operations. He toured a housing complex built on the Superfund site where around 1,000 residents had to leave their homes earlier this year due to lead contamination. Dozens of people held signs on Wednesday urging the EPA to continue clean-up efforts.     The Superfund program was started in 1980 to clean up hazardous waste sites, which now number just over 1,300 around the country.  The White House budget proposal submitted to Congress last month includes a 31 percent cut in spending for the EPA, including a similar reduction of the agency’s Hazardous Substance Superfund Account by $330 million to $762 million. Clean-up would continue in East Chicago, lawmakers said.  Pruitt, “made commitments that we would have it right,” Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly said.” There is a budget that is sent over and then there is a real budget that is put together. And the real budget will provide the funds necessary to make sure East Chicago is right.”  East Chicago, around 25 miles (40 km) outside of Chicago, was home to the now defunct U.S. Smelter and Lead Refinery Inc which contaminated the facility and surrounding areas with lead and arsenic. Demetra Turner, 44, a resident of the West Calumet Housing Complex who has yet to leave, urged others to keep pressure on the EPA.  “Keep fighting people, keep fighting, because that is what it takes,” she said.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON  —   In an extraordinarily swift return to politicking after a tumultuous first month in office, the White House on Wednesday said President Trump will hold the first campaign rally of his    administration on Saturday. The rally, to be held in an airplane hangar in Melbourne, Fla. is an indication that Mr. Trump, who has sometimes felt isolated in the White House, is eager to get outside of Washington and relive the rapturous reception that greeted him during the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump exulted in large crowds assembled at cavernous venues throughout his 2016 bid, and spent the first days of his presidency quibbling over how many Americans attended his inauguration. On Wednesday, during a joint news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Trump answered a question about whether his administration was flirting with xenophobia and racism in part by noting the support he received in the election. “I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had  —   306 Electoral College votes,” Mr. Trump said. “There’s tremendous enthusiasm out there. ” Not long after, in a posting on Twitter, Mr. Trump invited his nearly 25 million followers to attend the Saturday evening event, which will take place just up the coast from his    retreat in Palm Beach where he plans to spend the weekend. It will be his third weekend in a row on Florida’s Gold Coast. “We are going to put America back to work,” a message accompanying the posting said. “We are going to put people before government. ” The White House would not provide any additional information about the rally. Officials referred questions to a member of Mr. Trump’s political organization, who also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “It’s being run by the campaign,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday, without elaborating. He would not say why the president would be holding a campaign rally so soon after taking office. The rally will be only the second public appearance by Mr. Trump outside of Washington since he took office. On Friday, he is scheduled to visit a Boeing plant in North Charleston, S. C. for the unveiling of the aerospace manufacturer’s new Dreamliner aircraft. Mr. Trump filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission for his 2020   campaign on Jan. 20, the day he was sworn in. That allowed him to continue to accept contributions  —   including proceeds from the sales of his popular red “Make America Great Again” hats  —   without running afoul of the law. Mr. Trump ended the 2016 campaign flush with funds, in part because of substantial sales of the hats. At the end of 2016, he had $7, 611, 702. 92 cash on hand and no debt. The rally comes at a precarious time for Mr. Trump, as his White House is reeling from personnel turmoil and has yet to score any legislative victories. On Tuesday, he accepted the resignation of his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who had become embroiled in allegations that he had improper contacts with Russian officials before Mr. Trump took office. That was followed on Wednesday by the abrupt withdrawal of Andrew F. Puzder, the president’s nominee to be secretary of labor, amid allegations that he had abused his   and employed an illegal immigrant. Mr. Trump had vowed to move quickly to put his policy agenda in place once in the White House. But his effort to use executive power to crack down on immigration has faltered in the face of legal challenges, and his administration has yet to issue a proposal either for repealing the health care law he railed against during the campaign or enacting the tax overhaul he has promised. Larry M. Noble, the general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group, said he was not aware of any president having held a campaign rally this early in his tenure. “Usually, they are too busy trying to get their administration in place,” Mr. Noble said. “More importantly, normally the president wants to delay candidate status so that he can travel as president making speeches, announcing new policies and actions, promoting his agenda and attacking his opponents in Congress without having to use campaign funds. ” Barack Obama did not file his statement of candidacy for   until April 2011, more than two years after he took office, while George W. Bush waited until May of 2003 and Bill Clinton until April of 1995. Mr. Trump may be moving now, Mr. Noble said, to ensure he can address a friendly crowd devoid of protesters. “My guess is that he intends to control who is invited to the rally and press access by calling the rally a candidate event and paying for it out of campaign funds,” Mr. Noble said. “If it was an official White House event, he would have less control over it. ” Mr. Trump is likely to travel to the event on Air Force One and will have a sizable contingent of Secret Service and staff aides with him, as presidents always do when they travel. Campaign finance laws dictate that the cost of such a flight be shared between the campaign organizing the rally and the White House. It is not abnormal for a sitting president to hold a political rally in the months before an election, and Mr. Trump has said he plans to campaign actively for Republicans who support him and against Democrats who seek to stymie his agenda. But Mr. Trump’s return to the campaign trail on Saturday is unusually early.

0,WELFake Dataset,"MOSCOW/PARIS (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday it will spare no effort to defend the rights of Suleiman Kerimov, a Russian businessman and lawmaker who was arrested in the French Riviera resort of Nice in connection with a French tax evasion case. Shares in Polyus, Russia s biggest gold producer which is controlled by Kerimov s family, were down on the news of his detention.  The 51-year-old billionaire would be presented to a judge with a view to formally placing him under judicial investigation, a French public prosecutor said in Nice on Wednesday. Under France s legal system, being formally placed under investigation often, but not always, leads to a person being sent to trial.   We will do everything in our power to protect his lawful interests,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters.  Intensive work is now being undertaken by the foreign ministry.      A representative for Kerimov in the upper house of parliament, where he sits as a lawmaker, declined to comment on the case on Wednesday when contacted by Reuters. Polyus declined to comment. Russia s state-run Rossiya 24 TV station, citing an unnamed source, reported that Kerimov had denied any guilt. In the lower house of parliament, lawmaker Rizvan Kurbanov asked the Russian foreign ministry to make representations on Kerimov s behalf with the French authorities.  We have still not received from the French authorities any explanation of the reasons for the detention of our colleague,  Kurbanov told parliament.  All this testifies to an unprecedented demarche by the French,  he said, adding that he hoped the Russian foreign ministry would issue a formal protest. Shares in Polyus were down by more than 3 percent in early trade in Moscow but since then recovered some ground to trade at minus 2.3 percent by 1342 GMT. Originally from the mainly Muslim Russian region of Dagestan, Kerimov built his multi-billion natural resources business through a combination of debt, an appetite for risk, and political connections. He owned top flight soccer club Anzhi Makhachkala until he sold it in 2016. Kerimov s fortune peaked at $17.5 billion in 2008 before slumping to just $3 billion in 2009, according to Forbes magazine, due to so-called margin-calls on his assets triggered by the 2008 global financial crisis. In March this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree giving Kerimov the state award  For Services to the Fatherland, second class  for his contribution to Russian parliamentary life. French police arrested Kerimov at Nice airport on Monday evening. A French judicial source said the investigation centered on the purchase of several luxury residences on the French Riviera via shell companies, something that would have enabled Kerimov to reduce taxes owed to the French state.

President Obama s National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, told CNN s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday that  we should expect  Iran to use the money it gets under sanctions relief for military and even terrorist operations.As part of Obama s nuclear agreement with Iran, tens of billions of dollars frozen as part of the sanctions on Iran will be released over time   provided Iran complies with a list of deadlines outlined in the agreement. What do we think they ll spend that money on? We think, for the most part, they re going to need to spend it on the Iranian people and their economy which has tanked,  she told Blitzer.Of course, murderous regimes like Iran don t generally limit themselves to domestic infrastructure projects and welfare schemes, which Rice quickly acknowledged. But yes, it is real, it is possible, and, in fact, we should expect that some portion of that money would go to the Iranian military and could potentially be used for the kinds of bad behavior that we have seen in the region up until now,  she said.By  bad behavior  Rice is presumably referring to Iran s funding of terrorist organizations, and its expanding military operations throughout areas such as Yemen.Despite the fact that the Obama administration fully expects Iran to use its newly released billions to fund terrorism, Rice told Blitzer those concerns didn t play an important role in negotiations. The goal here, Wolf, was never, and was not designed to prevent them from engaging in bad behavior in the region. They re doing that today,  she said.  The goal is to ensure that they don t have a nuclear weapon, and therefore, when they are engaging in that bad behavior, are that much more dangerous. Rice s acknowledgement of Iran s bad faith might not bother the administration, but it is likely to cause a little concern in congress.After all, Iran s  bad behavior  is a pretty good indication that the murderous regime in Tehran has no intention of cleaning up its act   which makes it somewhat hard to trust they will abide by an Obama sponsored agreement.Via: BizPacReview",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Another wave of cholera could strike Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition blockade has cut off fuel for hospitals, water pumps and vital aid supplies for starving children, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Sunday. Dr. Nevio Zagaria, WHO country representative in Yemen, told Reuters that 16 percent of Yemeni children under the age of five suffer from acute malnutrition, including 5.2 percent with a severe form that is life-threatening, and the problem is increasing. Yemen, where 8 million people face famine, is mired in a proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthi armed movement and the U.S.-backed military coalition that the United Nations says has led to the world s worst humanitarian crisis. Some 960,000 suspected cases of cholera and 2,219 deaths have been reported since the epidemic began in April, WHO figures show. Children account for nearly a third of infections of the waterborne disease, spread by food or water contaminated with human feces, that causes acute diarrhoea and dehydration and can kill within hours if untreated. Although the number of new cases has dropped for 11 straight weeks, 35 districts in Yemen are still reporting cholera with  high attack rates  in communities, Zagaria said. A deteriorating economic situation and lack of safe drinking water, due to water sewage systems in many cities lacking fuel for the pumps, have compounded the humanitarian crisis, he said.  This is a perfect mix to have a new explosion of a cholera epidemic at the beginning of the rainy season in March of next year,  Zagaria said in a telephone interview from Sanaa, amid four days of clashes in the capital city. WHO is working with local authorities in both the internationally recognized government and Houthi-controlled  Sana a to identify areas at highest risk of a spike in the cholera epidemic and to boost defences, he said.  A campaign of oral cholera vaccination - initially planned last July during an acute phase and then abandoned by authorities - is now under reconsideration but as a preventive action next year, he said. Meanwhile, a ship carrying 35 tonnes of WHO surgical and medical supplies is being diverted to Aden after waiting weeks to offload at Hodeidah port, Zagaria said.  We are waiting and hoping that the situation of the blockade will be resolved. We have an opening to the humanitarian blockade but the opening to the commercial blockade is only partial,  he added. The United Nations appealed on Friday to the coalition to fully lift its blockade of Yemen, which was partially eased last week to let aid into Hodeidah and Salif, and U.N. flights into Sanaa.  The U.S.-backed military coalition closed air, land and sea access on Nov. 6 in a move it said was to stop the flow of Iranian arms to the Houthis, who control much of northern Yemen. Aid shipments cover only a fraction of Yemen s needs, since almost all food, fuel and medicine are commercially imported. Yemen s health system has virtually collapsed, with most health workers unpaid for seven months. WHO supports 130 hospitals across the country, providing fuel, water, oxygen, drugs, medical supplies and essential equipment, Zagaria said.  The (fuel) contractors that we are working with are finding difficulty in keeping the stock,  he said, noting that some hospitals require 60,000 liters of fuel per month.  WHO runs 15 stabilization centers for severely acute malnourished children with medical complications and is expanding with 10 more, Zagaria said.  We see that there is a constant flow of newly admitted patients to these centers.  The deterioration of the situation in terms of malnutrition in children is increasing... It is very difficult to quantify with precise numbers,  said Zagaria, who went to the intensive care unit of the pediatric ward in Sadaa last week.

0,WELFake Dataset,"posted by Eddie Pythagoras was a Greek philosopher, mathematician and founder of Pythagoreanism. He was also a high ranking member in many mystery schools and secret societies, including the Egyptian Priesthood and The Order Of The Magi. Pythagoreanism is a religious movement in which he attempted to merge education, science and religion in perfect unity. The Pythagorean School consisted of nine temples for the different subjects which included- geometry, music, astronomy, philosophy, medicine, politics and especially mathematics. His esoteric teachings were guarded closely and more secretive, candidates were given a probationary period to pass through. This was used to test their mental capabilities and their ability to maintain secrecy. Those who passed through this process were initiated into a select brotherhood in which they pursued religious and ascetic practices he had developed. This group were called Esoterici – The Esoteric. Pythagoras, Phidias and Fibonacci are all names that come up in association to the golden ratio, Phi or the Fibonacci sequence. But Pythagoras was the first to use it on a musical scale. According to legend, Pythagoras discovered musical tones when he walked passed a blacksmiths and was captured by the sounds emanating inside. He thought the harmonies could be translated into a mathematical equations. He later went into the blacksmiths and learnt how the sounds were made by observing their tools. He realised that the hammers had simple ratios to each other, one hammer was half the size of the first, another was 2/3 the size, and so on. This story cannot be validated, however it is fascinating to think that one of the most (if not the most) significant audio scales were discovered in this way. The fibonacci sequence is the number sequence 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13 and so on to infinity. This mathematical formula is found by adding up the two numbers before it in the sequence 0+1=1 1+1=2 1+2=3 2+3=5 and so on. The space between these numbers gives us the golden ratio of 1.618. This sequence unifies the properties of space, time, light, gravity and our genetic makeup within our DNA code. Our faces have this ratio and so do our bodies, you can find this ratio in our upper arm to lower arm and upper leg to lower leg. Even our brains are constructed with this ratio, with our pineal gland (which is thought to be the seat of the souls in many teachings) spiraling with this magical formula. Our pineal gland also produces melatonin and DMT which is thought to cause dreams and spiritual states. This ratio exists within flower petals, trees, seeds, natural foods, shells, the galaxies in the universe, it is truly the mathematical language of the universe. Given the significance of this, you may be able to see why listening to music tuned at this frequency could be a good thing. You can view more information about Pythagorean tuning and in specific the frequency of 432Hz in the video below.

0,WELFake Dataset,"  students are overwhelmingly awarded the Truman Scholarship, a federal scholarship granted to U. S. college juniors for demonstrated leadership potential and a commitment to public service, according to a survey by The College Fix. [According to the survey, more than a third of Truman Scholarship recipients have ties to Democratic politicians or leftist activist groups. Only several had ties with Republican or   organizations.  More than 40 of the 112 scholars in 2015 and 2016 have ties to Democratic politicians or liberal groups while less than a handful were found to have worked for Republicans or conservative organizations. Among the 2015 Truman Scholars, at least 26 had either worked for Democratic politicians and administrations,   organizations or were members of the College Democrats before or after they were awarded the Truman Scholarship. The Fix identified only two scholars as having ties to Republicans or conservative groups on their resumes. Multiple scholars interned for local and Congressional Democratic lawmakers, as well as at the White House during President Barack Obama’s tenure. Scholar Frank Smith was a fellow for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. Another, Katherine Hamilton, worked on Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. Others worked for   think tanks and advocacy groups such as the Brookings Institute, Planned Parenthood, Feminist Majority Foundation, NAACP and Urban Institute. The survey revealed that 16 recipients had worked for Democratic candidates, while only two had worked for Republicans. When asked about the discrepancy, Andrew Rich, the executive director of the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation claimed that the foundation doesn’t discriminate based upon an applicant’s political activity. “We’re really focused on what they’ve done by way of service and then their engagement with leadership around it. It’s fairly infrequent that it’s political,” Rich said. “Most [scholars] aren’t very political at all. ” “In all honesty, I mean, we do see both intellectual and ideological variety among our applicant pool.

Nevel, on the other hand, is white and has been running his campaign on the slogan  Unity through reparations,  and has also spoken out against gentrification and police brutality.Then there is the Uhuru Solidarity Movement, a socialist organization of white people who believe that the key to ending racial inequality is through reparations, but Congemi sees things from different angle.

Jesse Nevel also saw the move as tactless, saying that Congemi s comment reflects a segment of my community. I ve met plenty of other people who feel that way. That s why I feel that it s important for those of us in the white community to take a public stand with reparations. In typical Republican fashion, Congemi tried to weasel his way out of the firestorm he had created, telling the Washington Post that he has  nothing against African Americans who are doing their best here in America,  and that his remarks were only aimed at those who are pushing for reparations. He even referred to Nevel as a  self-hating white man. The controversy doesn t seem to have slowed Congemi down, and he claims that anyone who believes he is racist simply misunderstood his comments. Even if he loses this time, he s not going to stop. I ll run again in 2019 and, God willing, if I m alive in 2021, I ll run then, too,  Congemi said.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Because only a  Right Wing Nut  believes if you re paying a fortune to attend college, you should get an actual education The guiding principle of the University of Wisconsin is the Wisconsin Idea, a concept first outlined in 1904 by then-UW President Charles Van Hise who declared,  I shall never be content until the beneficent influence of the University reaches every home in the state. With the rise of the Progressive Movement, which pioneered populist and socialist reforms, the UW came to view the Wisconsin Idea as a mandate to use its research powers to influence and direct government policy.Today, the university proclaims:  The Wisconsin Idea is the principle that the university should improve people s lives beyond the classroom. It spans UW Madison s teaching, research, outreach and public service. With higher education costs skyrocketing and student loan debt hanging over graduates for decades after college, Media Trackers is launching a weekly feature that looks at individual University of Wisconsin professors and measures their area of research, and the classes they teach, against the standard of the Wisconsin Idea.Prof. Karma R. Chavez is an associate professor at UW-Madison s Department of Communication Arts. According to a UW employee salary database maintained by the Wisconsin State Journal, Chavez made $87,224 during the 2014-2015 fiscal year, and has achieved tenure at the school.Chavez teaches seven different courses, ranging from  Queer Theory  (CA 969) to  Queer Migrations  (CA 610) and  Rhetoric and Queer Theory  (also CA 610).Chavez takes pride in her work co-founding of the Queer Migration Research Network, and the UW s Comparative US Studies (CUSS) group.  I work with various grassroots social justice organizations and collectives,  claims on her official UW biography.The Queer Migration Research Network describes what it does as, Queer migration scholarship critically explores how sexual and gender normativities shape, regulate, and contest contemporary international migration processes that stem from histories of colonialism, global capitalism, genocide, slavery, and racialized patriarchy. In a 2012 essay, Chavez argued that academics and the media should work together to eliminate references to border security when discussing the southern border in the context of the immigration debate, and instead talk about  border militarization.  Chavez claims in her piece that,  President Reagan s administration was most responsible for rolling out the immense infrastructure that would lead to the most drastic border militarization.  She further claimed that border security efforts use military tactics to control targeted populations along the border.According to Chavez, the consequence of border security efforts to date has led to the rape of women, including rape perpetrated by U.S. border officials. She cites no proof of this shocking assertion, writing only that,  many migrant women have reported being raped under the conditions of militarization for reasons that would not exist if not for militarization. Put another way, Chavez claims that if the U.S. abolishes all border security efforts, women seeking to cross the border will no longer be raped by U.S. border officials or those who ply in the smuggling of humans across the border.A weekly radio host on WORT, Chavez recently hosted shows that criticized Israel s efforts to defend itself from the terrorist group Hamas and examined the  cultural history of American nudism. Nowhere on her website does Chavez try to connect the study of  queer migration  to the Wisconsin Idea of  improve[ing] people s lives beyond the classroom.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Washington (CNN) Loretta Lynch was sworn in as the new U.S. attorney general on Monday, replacing Eric Holder. Lynch, the country's first African-American woman to serve in the role, had her nomination held up more than five months over politicking in the Senate.

""Ladies and gentlemen, it's about time,"" said Vice President Joe Biden at the swearing in ceremony.

The highly politicized five-month battle to choose Obama's next attorney general came to a close Thursday when the Senate finally voted 56-43 to confirm Lynch

But the delay of her nomination neared record-breaking proportions. Republicans leading the Senate refused to bring her nomination up for a vote until Democrats cut a deal on abortion language in an unrelated bill. That legislation passed Wednesday, setting up Thursday's vote and ending the latest partisan Washington standoff.

Ten Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, joined Democrats. Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz was the only senator not to vote.

Obama tapped Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder in November and her nomination cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in February. Still, she waited longer than the seven most recent U.S. attorneys general combined for a vote on the Senate floor, after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell insisted on first finishing work on an unrelated bill.

Loretta Lynch's father, Lorenzo A. Lynch, was in the Senate gallery watching when the historic vote took place confirming her daughter as the first African American female attorney general.

""The good guys won. That's what has happened in this country all along,"" Lorenzo Lynch told reporters. ""Even during slavery. Levi Coffin was a founder of the Underground Railroad. Even during slavery. A white man fought against slavery. So all over this land good folks have stood in the right lane, in the right path.""

A two-time U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Lynch takes on the high-profile job at time when America faces a series of challenges, from dealing with strained relations and deep distrust in some cities between the police and the communities they serve, to criminal justice reform, to confronting the ongoing threat of terrorism.

Lynch, 55, has earned a reputation as a highly qualified, but low-profile prosecutor who has a good relationship with law enforcement and a history of handling tough cases well.

She is a good listener and a skilled consensus builder, qualities that will help her succeed at Justice, said Tim Heaphy, a former U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia who served under Lynch on the Attorney General's Advisory Committee, a group that meets regularly to advise the Justice department on policy matters.

""In that [attorney general] job you are at the center of so many of the emerging, significant, pressing issues not only in this country but around the world. There's probably no job in government as diverse and challenging as being attorney general of the United States,"" Heaphy said. He added that building support for initiatives both within and outside the department is an important part of the job.

""She will be good at getting people to work well together. I think that's a strength of hers. I saw that on the committee,"" Heaphy said.

Lynch's portfolio will include addressing voting rights, white-collar crime and policy reviews, as well as public corruption, an area in which she has vast experience.

In a statement, Obama said America will be better off with Lynch leading the Department of Jusice.

""Loretta's confirmation ensures that we are better positioned to keep our communities safe, keep our nation secure, and ensure that every American experiences justice under the law,"" Obama said in a statement shortly after the vote.

Lynch's experience on civil rights case, like helping win the convictions of New York City police officers who sexually assaulted Haitian immigrant Abner Louima, will be important as her office tackles closely watched investigations in recent police conduct cases, including the still unexplained death of a 25-year-old Baltimore man while in police custody.

""She's seen and understands the injustices that have taken place in the past and so therefore she's uniquely also equipped to deal with what's going on and do the kinds of investigations that will restore faith to Americans in their justice system,"" said Rep. Greg Meeks, D-New York.

Born in Greensboro, North Carolina, Lynch grew up 60 miles to the east in Durham, North Carolina. Her father was a fourth-generation Baptist minister; her mother, an English teacher and school librarian. As a child, Lynch rode on her father's shoulders to his church, which served a meeting place for students organizing anti-segregation boycotts in the early 1960s, she told the Judiciary panel at her January confirmation hearing. Lynch eventually graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School.

Speaking at her nomination announcement in November, Lynch highlighted the fact that the Justice Department is named for an ideal.

""This is actually appropriate, because our work is both aspirational, and grounded in gritty reality,"" she said. ""Today, I stand before you so thrilled, and, frankly, so humbled to have the opportunity to lead this group of wonderful people who work all day and well into the night to make that ideal a manifest reality.""

At a conference meeting with all the nation's U.S. attorneys a few years ago, Heaphy was put in charge of organizing a presentation showing the attorneys as they were 20 years before. Lynch shared a picture of herself with her college cheerleading squad.

""Loretta sent me a picture of her as a Harvard cheerleader in a pyramid,"" he said. ""She was comfortable sharing this with Eric Holder and other department leaders. She laughed at herself.""

""I don't think she's just tough, there's a humanity, there's a human touch that she has that will also serve her well,"" he said. ""Nobody is going to mistake that she's in charge, but her humility and sense of humor will come through.""",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

By Roberta Rampton 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) – Heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states. 
Jennifer Lopez will headline a free concert for Clinton supporters in Miami on Saturday, giving the former secretary of state a chance to connect with the key demographic of millennials she has sometimes struggled to reach – and some visual counter-programming to the latest email controversy to roil her race for the White House. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Friday it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Clinton’s use of a private email system – a late-breaking surprise that will likely continue to get extensive media play leading up to the Nov. 8 vote 
Celebrity-driven events like the concert “can serve as a bit of a distraction” from the controversy, said Eric Kasper, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. 
“It is a way to kind of take the edge off things because it tends to be more positive,” Kasper said. 
The JLo concert is the first in a series. Next week, Clinton will take the stage with Jay Z in Cleveland, and then with Katy Perry in Philadelphia on Nov. 5. 
A Harvard University poll this week showed that among likely voters aged 18 to 29, Clinton is leading Republican rival Donald Trump, a celebrity in his own right who starred in the reality television show “The Apprentice.” 
But turnout is a concern. The exceptionally negative tone of this year’s race for the White House has soured young Americans on politics, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows. 
Presidential candidates have long sought to create buzz with help from celebrity pals, said Tevi Troy, who chronicled the strategy in his book “What Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted: 200 Years of Pop Culture in the White House.” 
“Campaigns do it to reach out to people who are not necessarily interested in politics but are interested in pop culture,” said Troy, a presidential historian who worked in the George W. Bush White House. 
The events are like a larger version of a campaign yard sign, a way to show a “groundswell” of support behind a candidate – and a way to appeal to fans of the musicians, said Kasper, who has studied the intersection between pop culture and politics. 
“It can create a kind of psychological connection that we otherwise might not have when a politician endorses a presidential candidate, for instance,” Kasper said.

0,WELFake Dataset,"KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepalis began voting in the final round of municipal elections on Monday, an important step before a general election in November that will complete a near decade-long democratic transition after the abolition of Nepal s monarchy. The final round of voting covers parts of the restive southern plains that border India and are dominated by the ethnic Madhesi people. More than 2.6 million people are eligible to choose more than 6,000 representatives in 136 municipal, officials said. Voting in the area had been delayed since June after the Rastriya Janata Party Nepal (RJPN), which dominates the area, called for a boycott of the poll, a call that was only partially successful. Scores of people were killed in 2015 and 2016, mainly in clashes with police, in protests by the Madhesis against a new constitution that they said left them marginalised and favoured those living in the hills.     The Madhesis are demanding a unified homeland and greater participation in state organs, including parliament, the judiciary, bureaucracy, and the national army. However, lawmakers rejected a government proposal last month to amend the constitution and meet some of the Madhesis  demands. Pressure had mounted on the RJPN to take part in the municipal polls after some of its members quit the party and took part in the second round of polls in June. The first round was held in May.  We ll now take our demands to the people through this election and get them passed in future with their support,  Sarbendra Nath Shukla, a senior RJPN leader, told Reuters. The municipal elections, the first since 1997, are an attempt by the national government to restore democracy at the local level after a decade-long civil war that ended in 2006 and years of instability after the monarchy was abolished in 2008. They will serve as a barometer of public opinion ahead of the Nov. 26 general election. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration said on Wednesday that it will take aggressive action to combat other countries’  unfair trade practices and may defy World Trade Organization rulings that it views as interfering with U.S. sovereignty In an annual trade policy agenda document, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office said the administration “will not tolerate” unfair trade practices that distort markets, including currency manipulation, unfair government subsidies, intellectual property theft and state-owned enterprises. The document publicly released to Congress on Wednesday signals that the administration may try to push the limits of what is acceptable under WTO rules in its quest to make good on campaign promises to slash U.S. trade deficits with China and Mexico, and bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. The document represents a departure from the Obama administration’s strict adherence to WTO compliance in its challenges to unfair foreign trade practices. “Unlike earlier presidents, Trump is signaling a willingness to impose import restrictions — especially against a country like China — where the justification under WTO rules for doing so may be highly questionable,” said Chad Bown, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “The downside of the United States going down this path is that it is likely that other countries will follow suit immediately,” Bown added. The USTR document said it was not in the United States’ interest to let some WTO rulings undermine the use of effective remedies that the Geneva-based trade body expressly allows to fight unfair trade.    “Accordingly, the Trump administration will act aggressively as needed to discourage this type of behavior — and encourage true market competition,” the USTR said in the document. Laying out many of Trump’s trade plans in writing for the first time, the document said the Trump administration plans to strictly enforce U.S. trade laws, defend U.S. national sovereignty over trade policy, and use all possible leverage to open foreign markets to U.S. exports, the document said.  It makes clear the Trump administration’s view that U.S. law supersedes WTO rules — a view that could be invoked should Congress adopt a border tax adjustment plan to impose new taxes on imports that is later challenged as violating WTO tariff rules by other member countries. “The Trump administration will aggressively defend American sovereignty over matters of trade policy,” the report said. The nominee to be Trump’s top trade negotiator, veteran steel industry lawyer Robert Lighthizer, in 2010 advocated “aggressive interpretations of WTO provisions that might help us deal with Chinese mercantilism.” Lighthizer is awaiting confirmation by the U.S. Senate. He served as a deputy USTR in the Reagan administration, helping to negotiate import quotas on Japanese goods in the 1980s, with the help of powerful trade law provisions that have largely gone unused since the WTO was launched in 1995.

0,WELFake Dataset,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s would-be coalition partners continued talks on Friday after all-night negotiations failed to produce a breakthrough, with Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives saying they would compromise further on climate change policies to secure a deal. The conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens remained divided on climate policy and immigration, but agreed to press on past their self-imposed deadline into the weekend. Party leaders on Friday discussed their different stances on foreign, defense, trade and European policy in various formats and they were expected to continue on Saturday, haggling about climate protection, immigration, transport and agriculture. Speaking to reporters when she arrived for the talks in the morning, Merkel said:  I go into these negotiations with the intention, despite all the difficulties, of carrying out the task voters gave us of forming a coalition... It will be tough, but it s worth going into round two.  Volker Kauder, the parliamentary floor leader of her Christian Democrats (CDU), said they were prepared to compromise further on reducing emissions from coal-fired power stations to assuage Green concerns.  I feel readiness by all sides and everyone has to make concessions,  he told reporters as officials scheduled further talks to run to Sunday afternoon.  I believe that the exploratory talks must end this weekend.  Failure to agree could lead to new elections, something the mainstream parties fear could lead to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) making further gains after surging into parliament in September. A new election could also weigh heavily on the euro. Merkel could still approach her previous coalition partner, the Social Democrats (SPD), but they have said they want to stay in opposition after suffering their worst election result since 1933 in the Sept. 24 poll. A third option, a government without a parliamentary majority, would be unprecedented in Germany s post-war history. Merkel has been forced to explore the tricky option of a three-way  Jamaica coalition  - so-called because the parties  colors match the island nation s flag - after her camp lost votes to the far right. The smaller parties are under pressure from their rank-and-file supporters not to give ground as they haggle over concessions needed for a government program. To the right, Merkel s Bavarian allies in the Christian Social Union (CSU) want a coalition accord limiting immigration to shore up support in their home state, where the AfD threatens to unseat them after 60 years in power in a regional election next year. That is anathema to the left-leaning Greens, who want to preserve the right of successful asylum seekers to bring their families to join them in Germany - a position backed by two thirds of voters, according to a poll for ZDF television. The Greens fear giving way on their demand to close down 10 gigawatts of polluting coal-fired power stations would alienate their voters. They rejected Merkel s previous compromise offer of seven gigawatts. The FDP has only just returned to parliament after four years in the wilderness. Its deputy leader, Wolfgang Kubicki, sounded the most pessimistic after the talks, telling ARD TV the parties were  still so far apart on key issues such as migration, fighting climate change, finances and domestic security, that I can t imagine how we can get together in the short time available . In the evening, Kubicki said a new deadline to reach a provisional agreement was now Sunday at 6 pm (1700 GMT). FDP Party Secretary General Nicola Beer added:  We move forward a few inches each day.  The FDP wants tax cuts to please its small and medium-sized business supporters - a tall order, given competing fiscal demands. A booming economy could come to the parties  aid as the Ifo institute on Friday sharply raised its forecast for the German economy to grow by 2.3 percent from 1.9 percent this year, meaning Berlin can count on a higher tax take. A report by the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry on Friday found that rising tax revenues meant the government would have 76 billion euros ($89.63 billion) spare to spend over four years - twice an earlier finance ministry estimate.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Sarah Palin is an idiot. While this has been commonly accepted ever since she slinked out of her slime pit and emerged on the political scene, Palin recently managed to be so utterly stupid that it prompted an official White House response. After Palin s son Track drunkenly beat his girlfriend and made threats with a semiautomatic weapon, Caribou Barbie did the only thing she knows how to do: she blamed that socialist Communist Muslim atheist fascist dictator Barack Obama.Sure, the half-term, half-wit former Governor of Alaska could have had a moment of self-reflection, questioning her role as a parent and what she did wrong in failing to instill proper values in her precious little snowflake. She could have spoken out against domestic violence in general, and pointed out that it is an issue that faces many families, including hers. She could have said nothing at all. Instead, she told a crowd at a Donald Trump rally that Obama gave her son PTSD when he served in Iraq for a single year under Bush, and blamed Track s violent tendencies the President s blatant attempt to deprive veterans of medical and psychological treatment (failing to mention that  it was actually Republicans who slashed the budget for veterans  care): I can talk personally about this, I guess it s kind of the elephant in the room. My son like so many others, they come back a bit different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military so sacrificially have given to this country. And that starts from the top. It s a shame that our military personnel even have to wonder, if they have to question, if they re respected anymore. It starts from the top. The question though that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder, do you know what we go through? Do you know what we re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us? I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of some PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with,  Palin said.  And it makes me realize more than ever it is now or never for the sake of Americas finest that we have that commander in chief that will respect them and honor them. Earnest said that while it s easy to mock Palin   really easy   the topics she discussed are not a joke: The reaction of some people I think is to make light of some of the rhetoric that we see on the campaign trail, particularly from Gov. Palin. But the fact is domestic violence is not a joke. Gun violence is not a joke. Problems with addiction are not a joke. The consequences, or I should say, the sacrifices that many of our men and women in uniform make for our safety and security are not a joke. We take [those issues] very seriously and there are many communities and families that are dealing with these very difficult challenges in a way that is sometimes difficult to talk about publicly,  he said.Classy   something one would never expect from someone who would fling herself on top of a dogpile in a drunken brawl her family started at someone s birthday party.Watch Earnest eloquently destroy her below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHuDTaEGJ2s&w=560&h=315]Featured image via screengrab (1,2)",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Donald Trump must be forced to resign or be impeached, because this is really bad.On Monday, Trump s delusional alternate reality was shattered into a million tiny pieces when FBI Director James Comey shot down his accusation that President Obama wiretapped him AND revealed that Trump is under investigation for possible collusion with Russia during the 2016 Election.As Comey spoke, one can only imagine that Trump was throwing a massive hissy fit as his wall of lies crumbled all around him and on live television no less.And we all know how much Trump hates being humiliated on national television. His rants about Saturday Night Live have demonstrated that perfectly.The American people had a front row seat as Trump s credibility was flushed down the toilet into the very swamp he claimed he would drain.Trump is only 60 days into his presidency and he is already an unprecedented failure.Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley s evaluation of Trump s crash and burn is damning and only makes it clear that Trump will be the biggest loser in presidential history.Usually, historians avoid using the word  treason  when they evaluate a president, but Trump s case is so far beyond the pale that Brinkley pretty much had no choice.The fact that Trump is under investigation by the FBI right now and has been for months is absolutely astounding. There s a smell of treason in the air,  Brinkley told the Washington Post.  Imagine if J. Edgar Hoover or any other FBI director would have testified against a sitting president? It would have been a mind- boggling event. Indeed, even Richard Nixon didn t suffer such an embarrassment during his presidency despite being the only president who has resigned the office in disgrace. At this rate, Trump is on pace to become the first to ever be ousted via impeachment. This is the most failed first 100 days of any president,  Brinkley continued.Again, Trump still has 40 days to go before his first 100 days are completed. Yet he is already plagued by scandals and the American people despise him. To be as low as he is in the polls, in the 30s, while the FBI director is on television saying they launched an investigation into your ties with Russia, I don t know how it can get much worse,  Brinkley concluded.But it will get worse, especially as Trump s policies begin to take their toll on our nation. The GOP healthcare bill that Trump thinks is  wonderful  is set to strip health insurance from tens of millions of Americans while causing the price of healthcare to skyrocket.Trump is gutting environmental protections, education, workplace regulations, food aid programs, the State Department, the United Nations, and just about anything else that helps or improves the lives of Americans, all while seeking huge tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy.And it s all to fund his useless border wall and an increase in spending to a military that he uses irresponsibly.Trump has also strained relations with China, Australia, Mexico, Germany, and Great Britain as international tensions rise.Clearly, it can get worse, and it likely will continue to do so until Republicans in Congress finally recognize that Trump is a threat to our republic and our survival as a nation.Featured Image: Capitol Hill Blue ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Crowds packed U.S. bars on Thursday to watch former FBI chief James Comey testify to Congress, with some patrons dismissing the hearing as hype and others cheering his comments as they downed mixed drinks with names like “impeachmint” and “bad hombre.” From Capitol Hill to San Francisco’s Castro district, television “watch parties” beckoned politics buffs to taverns, restaurants and living rooms to view an event some likened to the “Super Bowl of Washington.” The drama around Comey’s first public appearance since he was fired by President Donald Trump last month drew the kind of communal public interest more often associated with major sporting events and awards shows. Every seat was taken at the Union Pub in Washington, located in the shadow of the building where Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee for about three hours from 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT). Comey accused Trump of dismissing him to try to undercut the bureau’s investigation into possible collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign team and Russia’s alleged efforts to influence the election. The pub had promised to buy patrons a round of drinks every time Trump, a prolific Twitter user, tweeted during Comey’s testimony - but drinkers were out of luck. The president did not launch a single public retort during the hearing, although his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., sent several tweets attacking Comey.  “(Comey) did in no uncertain terms call Trump a dishonest person,” said Jared Sorhaindo, 30, who works as a researcher. “That was one of the things that I thought would make Trump fly off the handle.” Mark Johnson, 69, self-employed from Rockville, Maryland, was one of the few Republicans in the packed bar and defended the Republican president. “It is kind of selective outrage on the part of Democrats, and I don’t think that what Trump did rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors,” Johnson said, referring to one of the standards that can trigger congressional impeachment proceedings against a president. At Houston’s Axelrad Beer Garden, a crowd of 200 people applauded when Comey called Trump’s rationale for firing him “lies, plain and simple.” Texas leans Republican but Houston, the largest city in the state, voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in November. “So far, no smoking gun,” said Cesar Robles, 35, watching the hearing at the bar. “Not much is going to be done” as a result of the testimony, he said. Back at the Union Pub in the nation’s capital, Joseph Cortese, a 22-year-old intern working for a Republican congressman, said the hearing was overblown and would not affect Trump or his agenda. Some Democrats have suggested Trump could be impeached and removed from office if he was found to have sought to hinder the Russia probe in a way that obstructed justice. That is seen as very unlikely given Republicans control both chambers of Congress. “I think the media and liberals are going to have to move on and accept the fact that Donald Trump is going to be president for the next four years,” Cortese said.

0,WELFake Dataset,"A new study conducted by Duke University found that hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has not contaminated the groundwater in West Virginia. [Duke’s study found that the claim by many environmentalists that fracking contaminates the groundwater does not hold up, because the groundwater was already contaminated from methane and salts before the fracking occurred.  “Based on consistent evidence from comprehensive testing, we found no indication of groundwater contamination over the   course of our study,” Avner Vengosh, the professor of geochemistry and water quality at Duke’s Nicholas School of the Environment, said. Vengosh and other scientists concluded that, while fracking did not contaminate the groundwater, accidental spills of fracking wastewater could pose a threat to surface water in the area. ”However, we did find that spill water associated with fracked wells and their wastewater has an impact on the quality of streams in areas of intense shale gas development,” Vengosh added. “The   assessment,” he continued, “is that groundwater is so far not being impacted, but surface water is more readily contaminated because of the frequency of spills. ” Researchers collected water samples from 112 drinking wells in northwestern West Virginia and studied them over a three year period. They sampled 20 of the water wells before drilling or fracking started in the area in order to obtain a baseline for later comparisons.

Obama doesn t care about Flint, MI anymore than he cares about the violence and out-of-control crime in his own backyard of Washington DC. The only reason Obama and his Democrat cronies are showing any concern for the citizens of Flint today, is because they are using their water crisis as a political football. They re attempting to blame the Republican Governor of MI for the water crisis, while doing everything in their power to hold Obama s evil EPA Director, Gina McCarthy harmless. If Obama cared so much about the residents of Flint, MI, why wouldn t he be as concerned about helping them to find employment as he is about phony climate change? Flint   President Barack Obama s assurances Wednesday that Flint s water is safe to drink from faucet filters was met with skepticism among residents of this predominately African-American city beset by fears of lead lingering in their pipes.Obama used his visit to the crisis-stricken city of 100,000 residents to promote the use of lead-removing faucet filters in an effort to bring some calm among residents distrustful of government. Although I understand the fear and concern that people have, and it is entirely legitimate, what the science tells us at this stage is you should not drink any of the water that is not filtered but if you get the filter and use it properly, that water can be consumed,  Obama said in a speech at Northwestern High School.  That s information that I trust and I believe.  Via: Detroit NewsFlint, MI has been living in crisis mode for decades. It s very likely they believed that when Barack Obama took office, he would do something to improve the conditions of their hell-hole of a city. They couldn t have been more deceived: Business Insider   We ve been ranking America s most dangerous cities for several years, and there s one city that keeps making the top of the list   Flint, Michigan.Flint had 66 homicides in 2012, tying a record it hit two years ago.Forbes has also ranked Flint as one of most dangerous places for women. The most striking attack of 2012 occurred when an 87-year-old woman was raped outside her home in broad daylight. She decided to leave Flint. GM s Flint operations employed 80,000 people in 1978. At the time, New York City had a reputation for being the most dangerous place in America   not Flint.However, the tide started to turn for Flint in the  80s. That s when GM started setting up factories in Mexico and dramatically reduced its operations in Flint. By 2006 GM employed just 8,000 people in Flint, according to Flint s city manager.With no major industry in Flint, the city s unemployment and poverty rates have soared as many people have fled the city. Here are some factors that contribute to making Flint a dangerous place:Flint only employed 122 police officers in 2012, down from 265 five years earlier because of budget cuts, Mlive.com reported. With 122 officers, Flint employs one officer for about every 830 people. Comparatively, New York City (which didn t even make the top 25 most dangerous cities) covers about 235 people per cop.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Flint s unemployment rate rests as 16.0 percent. Though not as low as Detroit s, which rings in at 17.5 percent, Flint s lack of work doesn t bode well for the local economy. More than 38% of people there live below the poverty level, according to the most recent Census numbers. Poverty and crime are known to go hand in hand.Drugs are a known accelerant for crime, including violent crime. Heroin use has increased dramatically among people between 18 and 29, the Flint Journal reported in 2011. That year, two teenagers died of overdoses within three days of each other.As things get worse in Flint, its population continues to drop off. There were nearly 125,000 people living there in 2000, but that number declined to roughly 101,000 by 2011.

The verdict was announced around 2:55 p. m. on Friday. [St. Anthony police Officer Jeronimo Yanez testified during the trial that    Philando Castile had his hand on a gun.  A Facebook video live streamed by Diamond Reynolds, his girlfriend who was in the car, went viral. She narrated as Castile sat dying. Officer Yanez fatally shot Castile on July 6 after a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, a suburb in St. Paul, Minnesota. At the time, there was a question as to whether Castile was a suspect in a recent convenience store robbery. Officer Yanez faced charges of manslaughter and reckless discharge of a weapon. The Minnesota jury has been deliberating this week. Shortly after the shooting, Officer Yanez’ lawyer said, “I can tell you that the stop of the vehicle for an equipment violation was not the only reason for the stop. ” A handgun was recovered at the scene. During the Facebook live stream, Reynolds said, “police just shot my boyfriend for no apparent reason. ” Castile had a concealed handgun license. During Yanez’ trial, a police force expert testified that the officer was justified in his use of force. Expert Joe Dutton told jurors “When Yanez saw the   grip of Castile’s hand, he had to react to the actions of Mr. Castile,” reported the CBS affiliate in Minnesota. He added, “This truly was a   decision, there wasn’t time to do anything else. ” A firefighter testified that he heard Castile’s gun drop to the ground from his pocket when he put him on a stretcher. Officer Yanez took the stand in his defense. He testified that he stopped Castile’s car after Castile drove past him and gave him a “deer in the headlights” look that made him suspicious. “It’s a trigger,” he testified. The officer was already on alert after the convenience store robbery and Castile looked like one of the robbery suspects. He radioed his partner that he was going to pull the car over because “[t]he two occupants just look like people that were involved in a robbery,” Minnesota’s Star Tribune reported. He also had legal grounds to pull Castile over because he was driving with a broken brake light. Yanez walked up to the car, and he could smell burnt or burning marijuana, he testified. The officer told the jury he saw Castile’s hand on the gun and Castile did not follow his instructions not to reach for the gun. He told the jury, “I told him, ‘Don’t pull it out,” but when he saw Castile pull out the top of the gun, “That’s when I engaged Mr. Castile and shot him. ” The officer testified when he saw Castile’s gun, “my family popped into my head. My wife. My baby girl. ” “I did not want to shoot Mr. Castile at all. ” “Those were not my intentions. ” After the shooting, Castile’s mother, Valerie Castile, reportedly told CNN, “I think he was just black in the wrong place. ” Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton further fanned the flame of racial tension when he asked at a press conference after the shooting  —   “Would this have happened if the driver and passenger were white?”  He answered his question saying  —   “I don’t think it would have,” reported Fox 9 News in  . Paul. As can be heard in the video, the officer told the girlfriend, “I told him not to reach for it. I told him to get his hand off of it. ” This occurs at the   mark in the video.

0,WELFake Dataset,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S. and Turkish troops are  illegal invader  forces on Syrian territory and Syria will  deal with  them, a top adviser to President Bashar al-Assad said on Tuesday. Bouthaina Shaaban also said in a television interview that Damascus would not give up on the northern city of Raqqa, which was liberated from Islamic State last month by the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).  Turkey today is a colonizer country, its forces on our soil are illegal, just as the American forces are on our soil  illegally,  she told Lebanese channel al-Mayadeen.  We will deal with this issue as we deal with any illegal invader force on our lands,  she said, without elaborating. Assad s forces, helped by Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, have managed to reestablish control over most of Syria over the past two years. The United States and Turkey are backing various rebel groups opposed to both Assad and to Islamic State. Turkey has started setting up observation points in Idlib province in northwest Syria under a deal with Assad s allies, Russia and Iran. The U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State in Syria has repeatedly said it does not seek to fight Assad s forces, though Washington and Ankara both want the president to step down. The SDF has said Raqqa will be part of a decentralized  federal Syria  and hopes for a new phase of negotiations that will shore up Kurdish autonomy in northern Syria, but last Friday a senior Iranian official said Syrian government forces would advance soon to take the city.  Everything is up to the Syrians and to discussions between Syrians, and there cannot be discussion on the division or cutting up of a part of the country or on so-called federalism,  Shaaban said. She added that what happened in Iraqi Kurdistan  should be a lesson  to the SDF, referring to Iraq s Kurdish leaders who suffered a major blow when the central government in Baghdad - backed by Iran and Turkey - retaliated against them for holding an independence referendum last month. Shaaban also said comments by the Syrian foreign minister in September, when he said Damascus was open to negotiations with the Kurds over their demand for autonomy within Syria s borders, had been misinterpreted.  I don t think any government can discuss with any group when it comes to the topic of the country s unity,  she said. Earlier on Tuesday, Assad said the army and its allies would keep fighting in Syria after it has driven Islamic State militants from their last significant stronghold in the country, in Deir al-Zor province. He also indicated that he might take the war to the SDF, which controls more than a quarter of Syria, by saying the war must target those who seek to  divide and weaken states .

Soon, cops across America will be wearing body cameras equipped with facial recognition software. 
Watchguard Video (WGV) claims their new “ Redactive ” software will enable law enforcement to identify anyone. (WGV is really, Enforcement Video LLC ) 
Redactive quickly scans the entire video clip first, automatically recognizing faces, so the user [officer] spends much less time manually performing the task. 
Police cameras automatically identify everyone’s face 
Redactive’s advanced facial recognition technology automatically detects and identifies human faces , minimizing the elements of the video which are falsely detected as human, thus reducing the overall time spent manually searching and marking the video for redaction. Users begin the redaction process by instructing the software to auto-detect any face in the video. Once auto-detection is complete, the software allows the user to select and redact the face or faces throughout the video.

0,WELFake Dataset,"The media doesn’t even try to hide its shameless pro-Socialist bias these days. Since nobody really pays attention to them anymore, you might have missed some of the more entertaining butthurt spouted by shameless propagandists posing as journalists.
2016 election night coverage on the propaganda news channels is a lesson in hilarity when examining the reaction of lamestream media talking heads. What is most entertaining about Trump’s ascendancy to the Oval Office is that it was totally unexpected, catching cocksure Marxists at CNN and other alphabet channels completely off guard.
Let’s go over some of the more entertaining reactions last Tuesday.
5. Hillary Shill Martha Raddatz Breaks Down In Tears 
Over at ABC, the wrinkled old Hillary shill Martha Raddatz was at a loss for words as she attempted to perform an off the cuff hamster rationalization to fellow Clinton operative George Staphylococcus, explaining why The Bitch lost the election.

Raddatz looked like her mother just died as victory turned into defeat for the criminal Hillary Clinton. She’s sure to be moving from a pack of smokes a day to two packs a day as the reality of the election continues to settle into her pea brain over the next 4 years. Her tears say more than her boilerplate language ever could.
4. Bernstein Plays The Race Card 
To the mainstream media, white people voting in accordance with their own self-interest is racist. In fact, white people acting in any other manner than total subservience is racist to CNN. Washington Post “journalist” Carl Bernstein even went so far as to say Trump’s election is “tragic and dangerous” as despondent and quite possibly drugged CNN propagandists looked on. Bernstein seemed most upset about Trump’s immigration policy proposals, in which Mexico will no longer be able to flagrantly let its citizens violate U.S. immigration law.
Bernstein completely forgot the racism white people have endured all year long at the hands of Black Lives Matter, La Raza and other black and brown supremacist groups.
3. Chris Matthews Goes Into Hamster Rationalization Mode 
Hamster rationalizations are usually reserved for women, but effeminate, low-T manlets like Chris Matthews also have them. His first spin of the hamster wheel makes him say Hillary won the debates. She didn’t. Then he says she had the best ad campaign. Nobody believes advertising or anything you say, anymore Chris. Then Matthews says she had the best ground game. She might have, but she was a terrible candidate. The half-man, half-alligator James Carville looked ready to give Chris a hug as the reality of Hillary’s defeat began to settle in on MSNBC.
2. The Racist Van Jones Whines About White People 
Van Jones looked like he needed a change of underwear as he fell back on tired, old leftist talking points from the 1960s about the evil white male —especially white males that haven’t been turned into geldings. He then goes on with an emotional overreaction to say families will be afraid to have breakfast the next day because whitey got back into office. LMFAO. Really, dude?
He then says immigrants are afraid now that Trump is going to be President. No Van, immigrants aren’t afraid. Illegal hordes who figuratively if not literally say “Fuck you!” to U.S. immigration law are afraid, as they should be.
Jones then goes on to make a supremely ironic quote as he talks about a so-called white-lash: He says Trump’s campaign was based on “Throwing away some of us to appeal more deeply to others.” Umm, isn’t that what the entire platform of the Democratic party is, Van? Throwing away, nay, crucifying white men to appeal more deeply to others ? Your entire career is based on just that, Mr. Jones.
1. CBS Does A Mea Culpa CBS published an article admitting how badly the press is biased
CBS was so stunned it did a full mea culpa on the network’s shoddy coverage of the 2016 election. This stunning article entitled “The Unbearable Smugness of the Press” needed to be written 10 years ago. Better late than never. CBS actually echoed what we in the manosphere and alt-right have been saying since day one with the Op-Ed piece.
This is all symptomatic of modern journalism’s great moral and intellectual failing: its unbearable smugness . Had Hillary Clinton won, there’d be a winking “we did it” feeling in the press, a sense that we were brave and called Trump a liar and saved the republic.
The Eyeball network even admitted the contempt the network has for men like us.
So much for that. The audience for our glib analysis and contempt for much of the electorate, it turned out, was rather limited. This was particularly true when it came to voters, the ones who turned out by the millions to deliver not only a rebuke to the political system but also the people who cover it. Trump knew what he was doing when he invited his crowds to jeer and hiss the reporters covering him. They hate us, and have for some time.
And can you blame them? Journalists love mocking Trump supporters. We insult their appearances. We dismiss them as racists and sexists. We emote on Twitter about how this or that comment or policy makes us feel one way or the other, and yet we reject their feelings as invalid.
Damn. At least some people over there know why we hate them. (That includes this former mainstream media news anchor who defected!)
Shameless Activism Got Marxism? It’s the guiding philosophy of the alphabet channels
Anyone who has the capacity to perform an iota of critical thinking knows the mainstream media is NOT on the side of the average American. It hates and seethes at traditionalists and works to tear down every institution of Western civilization while attempting to impale the most hated of creatures on this planet, the Evil White Male.
The rebuke of a sorry candidate like Hillary when the socialist shills thought she was a shoe-in caught the smug son of a bitches off guard. Their reactions are priceless, and need to be documented and remembered. These reactions are undeniable proof that blogs like Return Of Kings and web sites like Breitbart and Drudge are sorely needed, indispensable resources in this day and age.
We have not been getting the truth from media for generations. And now, as alternative voices appear, the rift between the two versions of reality grows wider and deeper. The once mainstream media have become nothing but shameless activists for New World Order socialism. The election night “horror show” only solidifies this point.
We should be proud to be activists pushing our own agenda, if nothing else to balance the scales. The media are NOT friends of the American public. Ultimately, the tired old Socialist media must be dismantled in order for freedom and traditionalism to survive .

0,WELFake Dataset,"Statistical Tie: Latest Breitbart/Gravis Poll Shows Donald Trump Closes the Gap with Less Than Two Weeks Left Clinton, at 46 percent, leads Trump at 45 percent by just one point Breitbart - October 28, 2016 Comments 
NEW YORK CITY, New York — Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has closed the gap with his Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton with just a couple weeks left in the election, the latest national Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing poll shows. 
Clinton, at 46 percent, leads Trump at 45 percent by just one point—inside the survey’s 2.3 percent margin of error. Libertarian Gary Johnson gets just 3 percent and the Green Party’s Dr. Jill Stein just 1 percent, while 4 percent are unsure. The survey was conducted from Oct. 25 to Oct. 26, sampling 1,824 registered voters across the United States. The poll was conducted using a combination of interactive voice response polling and an internet panel of cell phone users. 
“Something has happened since the third debate,” Doug Kaplan, the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, said of the poll. “Conventional wisdom was after Trump said he wouldn’t promise to accept the results of the election and made the ‘nasty woman’ comment, many thought Hillary would gain—but Trump seems to be closing the gap. In every election in the last 30 years, this happens where the person behind closes the gap. Hillary still has a clear electoral advantage and many paths to victory. However, Trump is not out of it but Hillary is still the favorite.” 
“This is a big story because it shows Trump really closing, importantly, as the other close polls are showing,” Democratic pollster Pat Caddell, who worked for President Jimmy Carter and is working with Breitbart News and Gravis Marketing on these polls, added. “He is closing with his favorability and unfavorability as well. 
Caddell said he thinks Obamacare’s failures, where premiums are skyrocketing, is one of many reasons why Trump is surging. “Among other things, that is contributing [to Trump’s rise in the polls],” Caddell said. “When we are looking down the road at other things that may be influential, we are seeing the possibility of again on the immigration issue—that thing about concern on the border seems to be increasing as is opposition to Hillary and their plans to expand immigration and refugees, which is another big issue. But more importantly, at the end of the survey, we see both candidates have problems on their ability to unite the country and on whether or not they can have the moral leadership to lead. They’re basically about the same, which I consider a real improvement for Trump now that he’s that close.”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A bill to send $700 million to cash-starved social services providers breezed through the Illinois Legislature on Thursday, as the state once again turned to stopgap funding measures in lieu of a budget. The measure passed the House 111-0 and the Senate 56-0. There was no immediate comment from Governor Bruce Rauner’s office on whether he will sign it into law. A memo from his budget office expressed concerns that language in the bill could actually prevent funding for some programs. Democratic State Representative Greg Harris said the money would be taken from state funds outside of Illinois’ general revenue fund to cover 46 percent of what the state has failed to pay service providers due to the ongoing impasse over the fiscal 2016 budget. “This is a $700 million piece of legislation that would help the neediest at the time they need help the most,” he said. Despite the stalemate between the Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature, about 90 percent of Illinois government is being funded through continuing appropriations, the enactment of a K-12 school bill, and court-ordered spending. But some parts of the government were left out in the cold. Earlier this month, dozens of unpaid social service providers sued Illinois, seeking more than $100 million. Andrea Durbin, chairman of the Pay Now Illinois coalition that filed the lawsuit, said that if enacted, the bill would not end the litigation. “It could provide a downpayment of the money we are owed, but it’s not a comprehensive solution for the Pay Now Illinois plaintiffs,” she said. In April, the legislature passed and Rauner signed a $600 million stopgap funding bill for state universities, community colleges, and student tuition grants that covered only 34 percent of the $1.7 billion that had been earmarked for higher education spending in the fiscal year that began on July 1. Illinois is the only U.S. state without a complete fiscal 2016 budget. Rauner earlier on Thursday acknowledged that some lawmakers are working on a budget framework. That framework involves higher taxes, spending cuts, and borrowing, according to local media reports.  “I’m cheering for bipartisan General Assembly members to come up with some solutions,” the governor told reporters.

We d love to know who made the decision to punish the American viewers with yet ANOTHER painful appearance by John Kasich on the debate stage over Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul Rand Paul and Carly Fiorina have been booted to the undercard in Thursday night s Republican primary debate as the number of main-stage candidates was cut to seven by stricter polling criteria.Paul, who is struggling to gain traction in the presidential race, immediately cried foul, and vowed to not participate in the event.Fox Business Network, which will televise the sixth GOP presidential debate this week, announced the debate fields on Monday evening, after weeks of speculation that Paul would for the first time not make the cut for the primetime event. The seven candidates who will appear on the main stage in North Charleston, S.C., are Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich. Kasich qualified as a result of his strength in New Hampshire. Paul and Fiorina are set to join Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum in the undercard   if Paul decides to participate. The Kentucky senator told CNN Monday evening, just before the official announcement, that Fox Business had made  a mistake,  and he wouldn t attend. We will not participate in anything that s not first-tier,  Paul said. His campaign confirmed to POLITICO that he will sit out Thursday s debate.His campaign elaborated in a statement that multiple polls showed him well within the network s criteria for qualifying, and contended that the margins of error in polls make them a poor tool for determining who makes the main stage. To exclude candidates on faulty analysis is to disenfranchise the voter,  the statement said.  Creating  tiers  based on electoral results of real votes might make sense but creating  tiers  on bad science is irresponsible. Regardless of whether he takes part in the undercard debate, the downgrade could be a crippling blow for Paul   who has insisted that he would remain in the race through the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses, even though he also faces a reelection campaign this year for his Senate seat.In an interview with POLITICO last week, Paul called for organizers to abolish the earlier undercard debate.  I m not sure what the purpose is anymore, if there ever was one,  Paul said. The Paul camp has fought hard to keep its candidate on the main stage, where he has appeared for the prior five debates. Earlier Monday, the campaign released a memo stating that  multiple national polls  have the Kentucky senator  in 5th or 6th place    even though he s in seventh place in the average nationally and in both early states.  By any reasonable criteria Senator Paul has a top-tier campaign and has qualified for the stage,  the memo said.But it was clear that Paul didn t meet the criteria Fox Business had outlined prior to Monday s qualification deadline. The network said it would average the five most recent polls nationally, and in both Iowa and New Hampshire. The top six candidates nationally would qualify   and if any other candidate appeared in the top five in either early state, they would be added.Paul was in seventh place nationally and in both early states, according to POLITICO s calculations.Fox Business outlined specifically which polls were used in a subsequent statement to reporters, saying the outlet used  the most recent national and state polls from non-partisan, nationally-recognized organizations using standard methodological techniques.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Democratic congressmen on Tuesday called on the Trump administration to demand strong labor provisions in its renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement to reverse chronic wage erosion in Mexico. At a public hearing in Washington tied to the imminent trade talks, U.S. representatives Sander Levin and Bill Pascrell, both members of the House Ways and Means Committee, said improved labor rights in Mexico was their top NAFTA priority.      “U.S. wages are being driven down by the depressed wages in Mexico,” Levin said in testimony. “Why? Because the entire Mexican labor system is designed to prevent workers from obtaining their rights and bargaining for better wages and working conditions.” Levin, citing a wage figure of about $2 an hour for Mexican auto plant workers versus about $28 for the United States, said that NAFTA must be modernized to ensure that Mexican workers have a true right to collective bargaining, replacing the current Mexican system of labor conciliation and arbitration boards. Negotiated in the early 1990s by the United States, Canada and Mexico, NAFTA lacks enforceable labor provisions. Levin and Pascrell said that new labor standards must have an enforcement mechanism that ensures full implementation of provisions before a new trade deal goes into effect. Pascrell also sharply criticized the Trump administration for failing to spell out clear and specific objectives for the NAFTA renegotiations, which are due to start on Aug. 16. “We in Congress – and the American public and the companies and stakeholders that make up the American economy – are completely in the dark when it comes to what the administration intends to do, why, and for whose benefit.” Pascrell also called for “major reforms” to NAFTA’s dispute resolution mechanism. Trump administration officials also have criticized the system, which it says is biased against U.S. interests.    The hearings, which also will include testimony from dozens of industry groups and companies on their hopes for the talks, will take place through Wednesday at the International Trade Commission in Washington. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office, which will take the lead role in the negotiations, is expected to publish more detailed NAFTA negotiating objectives around mid-July.

0,WELFake Dataset,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20 with a long list of promises for his first 100 days. His record has been mixed. Here are the main issues he has confronted and what he has achieved ahead of Saturday’s 100th day.  A pledge to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy, was among Trump’s central 2016 election campaign promises. It is also one of the biggest failures of his first 100 days.  A bill in the House of Representatives was withdrawn in late March when Republicans could not muster enough votes for passage even though they control the chamber.  A reworked plan this week has drawn support from the House Freedom Caucus, the conservative bloc that helped sink the original bill. That improves the chances of a deal in the House though it is unclear if it can win enough support from moderate Republicans, and it would face tougher challenges in the Senate.   Trump repeatedly promised the biggest tax reform since the 1980s. This week he proposed legislation to slash the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, cut the top personal income tax rate to 35 percent, repeal the inheritance tax, and temporarily slash the rate on overseas profits repatriated to the United States. The plan, however, is vague and even senior Republican lawmakers described it as offering only “guideposts” for legislative changes.  Trump’s foreign policy has been marked by major shifts. Russia: Trump spoke admiringly of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign and indicated he wanted a rapprochement with Moscow. But the administration has not been able to fend off a controversy that has led to a congressional investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, including possible links between Trump’s campaign and Moscow. Trump has cooled considerably toward Putin. Putin condemned Trump’s decision in early April to launch cruise missile strikes on Syria in punishment for a chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government, and Trump said the relationship with Russia “may be at an all-time low.”  North Korea: A growing nuclear and missile threat from North Korea is perhaps Trump’s most serious security challenge. He has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile, a capability experts say Pyongyang could have some time after 2020. Trump’s administration aims to push North Korea into dismantling its nuclear and missile programs through tougher international sanctions and diplomatic pressure. He has pressed China, North Korea’s biggest trading partner, to do more to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear program.  NATO: Trump alarmed U.S. allies during the election campaign by calling NATO “obsolete.” In mid-April he lavished praise on NATO and said it is not obsolete.  Syria: Trump had vowed to avoid entanglements in Middle East conflicts and, in his first days in office, said he did not want the United States dragged deeper into the Syrian conflict. But he responded to the chemical weapons attack, which killed dozens of people, by ordering strikes on a Syrian air base. That won praise from allies in Europe and from U.S. lawmakers.  Trump promised a crackdown on illegal immigrants entering the United States and the deportation of illegal immigrants living in the country, especially those with criminal records. He also pledged to build a wall along the border and to get Mexico to pay for it.  The approach and strong rhetoric have had an effect with the number of migrants caught trying to enter the country illegally hitting a 17-year low in March. The number of children traveling with a guardian and apprehended at the southern U.S. border plunged by more than 90 percent in March from December. Trump insists he will build the border wall, but in order to lift the threat of a government shutdown, he gave way on his demand this week that Congress include full funding for it in a spending bill.  Trump campaigned on a promise to bar the entry of Muslims into the United States, casting it as part of the fight against the Islamic State militant group. On Jan. 27, he ordered a temporary ban on the entry of nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Syria. He also indefinitely banned refugees from Syria and temporarily banned refugees from all other countries. A federal judge temporarily halted the ban, and a federal appeals court upheld that ruling. Trump issued a revised travel ban in early March, only to see it again blocked in federal court. Similarly, a federal judge this week blocked his order to withhold federal funding from so-called sanctuary cities, which offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants.  This is one of Trump’s clearest wins. His promise to select a like-minded successor to Justice Antonin Scalia, who died early last year, was kept with the nomination of Neil Gorsuch. The Senate confirmed Gorsuch despite Democratic opposition, restoring a conservative majority on the court.  Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal just days after his inauguration, keeping a campaign promise. Trump had both threatened to withdraw from or renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), blaming it for an exodus of U.S. jobs to Mexico. The threats of withdrawal had jolted financial markets at various times. On Thursday, Trump extended an olive branch, saying he would not terminate NAFTA after the leaders of Mexico and Canada asked him to work on a new trade deal.   Trump also ordered a review of the causes of U.S. trade deficits, such as dumping of products below cost; unfair subsidies; “misaligned” currencies; and “non-reciprocal” trade practices.  Trump had vowed to name China a currency manipulator, meaning the United States could then impose tariffs on Chinese goods. But in mid-April he changed course and said that China was not a currency manipulator. Trump has acted aggressively on his promise to eliminate regulations that he said were hurting the U.S. economy. He issued a permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. He also rescinded Obama-era climate change regulations, including the Clean Power Plan; a ban on coal leasing on federal lands; and rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production.  As part of a push to open up more federal lands to drilling, mining and other development, Trump ordered a review to identify national monuments that can be rescinded or resized. Legal challenges are expected.  His administration has approved a dozen measures rolling back regulations passed in the final months of the Obama administration on the environment, energy, education and financial services. Trump has pledged to keep U.S. companies from shipping jobs overseas. Before taking office, Trump used the muscle of his election victory to threaten companies about moving jobs abroad. He claimed victories with the Carrier unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and with Ford Motor Co (F.N), though Carrier still cut hundreds of jobs in Indiana and Ford said it scrapped plans for a Mexican factory because of declining demand for small cars in North America. The jury is still out on how successful he can be in keeping jobs from going overseas. Trump ordered a review of the H-1B visa program, which brings highly skilled foreign workers into the United States. He says he wants to modify or replace the current lottery system with a merit-based system for highly skilled workers.  This was one of Trump’s rallying cries during the campaign, saying he would change Washington by cracking down on the influence of special interests and political elites. He criticized Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for her paid speeches to Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs but has named several former Goldman executives to his inner circle. He did ban appointees of any executive agency from lobbying for five years after leaving government employment and permanently banned future former appointees from activity on behalf of any government or political party abroad.

Comment voter « Non » aux armes nucléaires par Manlio Dinucci Les États-Unis viennent de faire rejeter —par leurs alliés au sein du Premier comité de l’Assemblée générale de l’Onu— une proposition visant à l’élimination totale des armes nucléaires. Cependant, il est possible pour les États abritant illégalement des bombes atomiques états-uniennes d’en exiger leur retrait de leur territoire en application de l’article 2 du Traité de non-prolifération.
Réseau Voltaire | Rome (Italie) | 2 novembre 2016 italiano « Merci, président Obama. L’Italie va continuer avec une grande détermination son engagement pour la sécurité nucléaire » : c’est ce qu’écrivait le Premier ministre Matteo Renzi dans un message tweeter historique. Six mois après, aux Nations Unies, Renzi a voté « Oui » aux armes nucléaires. Se mettant à la queue des USA, le gouvernement italien s’est rangé contre la Résolution, approuvée à grande majorité dans le premier comité de l’Assemblée générale, qui demande la convocation en 2017 d’une conférence des Nations Unies pour « négocier un outil légalement contraignant pour la prohibition des armes nucléaires, qui amène à leur élimination totale ».
Le gouvernement italien a ainsi mangé son chapeau sur ce qu’il avait promis à la Conférence de Vienne, il y a deux ans, aux mouvements antinucléaires « exigeants », en les assurant de sa volonté d’opérer pour le désarmement nucléaire en jouant un « rôle de médiation avec patience et diplomatie ». Ainsi tombe dans le vide l’appel « Exigeons le désarmement nucléaire total », dans lequel on demande au gouvernement « la poursuite cohérente de l’engagement et de la lutte pour la mise au ban des armes nucléaires », dans un parcours « humanitaire et juridique vers le désarmement nucléaire », dans lequel l’Italie pourrait jouer « un rôle plus qu’actif, possiblement de pointe ».
Par conséquence tombent dans le vide aussi les motions parlementaires de la même teneur. Les appels génériques au désarmement nucléaire sont facilement instrumentalisables : il suffit de penser que le président des USA, artisan d’un ré-armement nucléaire de 1 000 milliards de dollars, a été décoré du Prix Nobel de la Paix pour « sa vision d’un monde libéré des armes nucléaires ».
Le mode concret à travers lequel en Italie nous pouvons contribuer à l’objectif du désarmement nucléaire, énoncé dans la Résolution des Nations Unies, est celui de libérer notre pays des armes nucléaires états-uniennes. À cette fin il faut non pas en appeler au gouvernement, mais exiger qu’il respecte le Traité de non-prolifération (TNP), signé et ratifié par l’Italie, qui à l’article 2 stipule : « Chacun des États militairement non nucléaires, qui soit Partie au Traité, s’engage à ne pas recevoir de quiconque des armes nucléaires ou autres engins nucléaires explosifs, ni le contrôle sur de telles armes et engins explosifs, directement ou indirectement ». On doit exiger que l’Italie cesse de violer le TNP et demande aux États-Unis de retirer immédiatement toutes leurs armes nucléaires de notre territoire et de ne pas y installer les nouvelles bombes B61-12, fer de lance de l’escalade nucléaire USA/Otan contre la Russie, ni d’autres armes nucléaires. Il faut exiger que des pilotes italiens ne soient plus entraînés à l’utilisation d’armes nucléaires sous commandement états-unien.
C’est l’objectif de la campagne lancée par le Comité No Guerra, No Nato et d’autres sujet. La campagne a obtenu un premier résultat important : le 26 octobre, au Conseil Régional de la Toscane, a été approuvée à la majorité une motion du groupe Sì Toscana a Sinistra (Oui, Toscane à gauche) qui « engage la Junte à demander au Gouvernement de respecter le Traité de non-prolifération des armes nucléaires et faire que les État-Unis retirent immédiatement toute arme nucléaire du territoire italien et renoncent à y installer les nouvelles bombes B61-12 et autres armes nucléaires ». À travers ces initiatives et d’autres on peut créer un vaste front qui, avec une forte mobilisation, impose au gouvernement le respect du Traité de non-prolifération.
Il y a six mois nous demandions sur les pages du Manifesto s’il y avait quelqu’un au Parlement disposé à exiger, sur la base du TNP, le retrait immédiat de l’Italie des armes nucléaires états-uniennes. Nous sommes encore en attente de la réponse.

0,WELFake Dataset,"KABUL (Reuters) - One of Afghanistan s most powerful regional politicians was ousted as governor of the northern province of Balkh on Monday, setting up a confrontation that adds to the uncertainty around President Ashraf Ghani s Western-backed government. Atta Mohammad Noor is one of the leading figures in Jamiat-e-Islami, a party which mainly represents Afghanistan s Tajik ethnic group, and has used his position in Balkh, on the northern border of the country, as a powerbase to push for a major role on the national stage. His removal, at a time when tensions between Tajiks and Pashtuns, Afghanistan s two biggest ethnic groups, have been rising, injects extra uncertainty to the already fractured political landscape ahead of presidential elections in 2019.  My dismissal has no legal or legitimate basis,  Noor said on Afghan national television.  For now we are only resorting to civil action but if this atrocity continues, there are many other options.  Atta Noor is one of a clutch of powerful regional and ethnic leaders whom Ghani has struggled to control since he came to office after the disputed election of 2014. Ghani, a Pashtun, has tried previously to remove him but also discussed a possible role in the government for him. He submitted his resignation several months ago but the move never took effect until Ghani approved it on Monday, announcing at the same time that Mohammad Daoud, also from Jamiat, would become the next governor of Balkh province.      The Afghan president has accepted Atta Mohammad Noor s resignation and announced Engineer Mohammad Daoud as the new governor,  Shah Hussain Murtazawi a spokesman for Ghani said. In his remarks on Monday, Atta Noor, who has demanded a number of senior positions in the government for some of his allies, said the resignation had been offered with conditions attached and said these had not been respected.  Since they didn t meet their responsibilities, I don t accept it,  he said. Ghani s national unity government, formed after the 2014 election forced him into an uneasy power-sharing arrangement with his former rival Abdullah Abdullah from Jamiat, retains the support of the international community and the United States. But it has faced mounting criticism from a growing array of opposition groups. Parliamentary elections originally due to be held next year are in doubt and former President Hamid Karzai has called for a loya jirga, or traditional grand council of political leaders and elders to decide the future of the government. The confrontation with Atta Noor comes several months after a standoff with Vice President Rashid Dostum over accusations of the sexual abuse of a political opponent. Dostum, an ethnic Uzbek leader and veteran of decades of Afghan politics, has been in Turkey since May, ostensibly for medical treatment. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

Today is the day,  she wrote on Election Day.  Go out and VOTE. Today is the day. Go out and VOTE  A photo posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Nov 8, 2016 at 8:01am PSTSo thirsty was the public for hints of Swift s political affiliations, that even an innocent picture of a voting line, stirred up a frenzy.  Who is Taylor Swift voting for?  skyrocketed in search queries, proving at the end of the cycle to have been one of the most popular search terms of the entire election.Fans read deeply into the symbolism of Swift s outfit and posture. Others took it as an opportunity to try to bait her into the political arena, pointing out her hypocrisy of having once styled herself as an outspoken feminist, only to back down at this most crucial moment. Admittedly some of those commentators had a point. It s difficult to look away from the fact that one of the most staunchly anti-woman candidates gallivanted into Washington followed by scores sexual assault accusations in tow, and Swift just watched.It is wrong to exploit feminism in order to sell records but then stand idly by as a misogynist ravages the country. Just FYI  Casey Mink (@Casey_Mink) November 8, 2016Swift remains to this day one of the only major A-list celebrities who has not weighed in on the election. Lady Gaga comforted fans distraught by Trump s successful attempts to reduce rape culture to  locker talk.  Kesha, Madonna, Beyonc , Nicki Minaj and Adele all connected with their fan bases to explain why Hillary Clinton offered the best way forward. Katy Perry literally did not stop singing and speaking for Clinton for the entirety of 2016. In a Time op-ed alongside a handful of clickier stunts, Swift bestie Lena Dunham said her support for Clinton was about far more than just  anatomy  or  girl power  Scores of artists have outright shamed the presidential inauguration committee for even asking to perform.Given her election silence, Swift has undoubtedly been approached, but her team has yet to offer a comment.A carefully chosen word of warning about the effect a successful Trump bid on normalizing misogyny or discrimination would have made for a natural extension of Swift s past desires to increase the level of public discourse around feminism. One could say the election is just another  narrative  she  never asked to be a part of,  and they would be correct. But if you re Swift, why not speak up? For every time she made sure that the word  feminism  was as close to her name in headlines, it feels odd she would pass on a lay-up as easy as helping clarify what  locker room talk  actually means. A close look at the fans she needs to please helps explain the silence. She caters to a white audience that used to be country and then crossed over into pop,  Ani Johnson, associate professor of Music Business at Berklee College of Music and international lecturer and consultant in music licensing, marketing and strategic startups, said in an email.  She has to  stay sweet,   stay demure    the perfect picture of the blond, blue-eyed, true blue, young American girl. She can t afford to speak up and lose sales from her red state, Republican base. It s clear to Johnson what that base wants:  a pretty girl who sings about love and has  effectively  nothing in her head.   Music.MicMeryl Streep s acceptance speech at the Golden Globes Award ceremony really backfired on her when conservatives in social media, and even some on the Left, were taken aback by her petulant attack on our President-elect Donald Trump.  Streep really gave her viewers an opportunity to see her mean, bully streak when she stood on the stage, and without any credible evidence to back it up, accused Trump of being a racist and demeaning a disabled reporter. Both of those claims are false, but who the hell needs facts when you re an Academy Award winning actress and can PRETEND they re true?The Left s obsession didn t start with Meryl Streep. As a matter of fact, some of the worst activists who mocked, lied and falsely accused Donald Trump of horrible things, were some of Taylor Swift s best friends.Hillary Clinton sycophant Lena Dunham, who admitted to sexually abusing her younger sister and lied to the world about being raped, likes to call Taylor Swift her  best friend.  She also promised to leave the country if Trump was elected. Unfortunately, she s still here. Her promise to leave the country was as honest as her manufactured claims about Donald Trump being a misogynist.Donald Trump hit back when Lena Dunham (along with a long list of  celebrities ) said she d leave the US if Trump won the election:Gigi Hadid can be seen frequently hanging out with Taylor Swift on Instagram and in the tabloids. Here s one of Swift s many photos with Hadid on her Instagram account:A photo posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Apr 29, 2016 at 1:25am PDTKudos to Taylor Swift for sticking to performing, and staying out of the fray when it comes to President-elect Trump; even when it means she will be harshly criticized by the people in her business for not jumping on the  Hate-Trump  bandwagon.

0,WELFake Dataset,"2016 N. B. A. Finals: Golden State Warriors ( ) vs. Cleveland Cavaliers ( ) Game 1: 9 p. m. Thursday at Oracle Arena, Oakland, Calif. How to watch: ABC has the television broadcast. Game 1 will be streamed live on WatchESPN. N. B. A. Finals Game 1 live updates  Stephen Curry, for the first time since last year’s N. B. A. finals, encountered something resembling adversity in the Western Conference finals. The Warriors fell behind, three games to one he was turning the ball over far too much and his opponents were mocking his defensive ability. Some fans even questioned his anointment as the game’s best player. With no margin for error, Curry responded by averaging 32. 7 points, 7. 3 rebounds, 7. 7 assists and 2. 3 steals in the final three games of the series, dismantling the Oklahoma City Thunder. It may be scary for the Cavaliers to think about, but an argument could be made that Curry was only his team’s   player in that stretch. Klay Thompson, the other half of the   Splash Brothers, showed a national audience what Warriors fans have known for years: When his shot is falling, he is as dangerous as his more famous teammate. He and Curry combined for 62   against the Thunder, an N. B. A. record for teammates in a playoff series. Thompson averaged 29. 7 points in the final three games, and his   performance on the road in Game 6 will perhaps be the most memorable showing of that series. The road to the finals was far less winding for the Cavaliers. They were steamrollering through the East, winning their first 10 playoff games, before a pair of brutal losses to Toronto in the conference finals. It proved to be a mild detour: There was little to no drama in Games 5 and 6, and now LeBron James is set to play in the N. B. A. finals for a sixth consecutive year. At their best, the Cavaliers can nearly keep up with the Warriors in   shooting. That should be the main story line of this showdown, not the overdone notion that James could find redemption by winning a championship for Cleveland. In any case, while the finals will be a rematch of last season’s triumph by the Warriors, both teams have grown. Expecting a    remake would be unwise. The most obvious change for the Cavaliers is the return of Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving. They played a total of  44 minutes in the N. B. A. finals last year, with Love hampered by a shoulder dislocation and Irving dropping out after Game 1 with an injured knee. Getting back a pair of   takes some of the burden off James, who   prevented the Warriors from having a cakewalk to a championship last year but was outdone by the defensive tenacity of Andre Iguodala and the overall offensive excellence of the Warriors. Love and Irving seemed to coexist better with James this season, accepting their roles while occasionally being asked to supply star power on nights when James was not at his best. Love averaged 16 points and 9. 9 rebounds a game while shooting 36 percent from   range, and while he is not known as an effective defender, most advanced defensive statistics showed him holding his own this season. Irving averaged 19. 6 points and 4. 7 assists a game while growing accustomed to the idea of being a point guard who gives up the   duties in crunchtime to James. The Cavaliers still probably use J. R. Smith and Matthew Dellavedova more than they would prefer, but Channing Frye proved to be a brilliant   acquisition, capitalizing on the   looks he gets when James is  . There is an argument to be made that the Cavaliers are to blame for the Warriors’     season. With his team looking overmatched and down by two games to one in last year’s N. B. A. finals, Kerr listened to an unorthodox suggestion from Nick U’Ren, his manager of advanced scouting, and deployed a starting lineup of Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Iguodala, Thompson and Curry. Playing a center who is generously listed at 6 feet 7 inches, a power forward who is a slight   and three guards would seem crazy in nearly any era of basketball, but the group, which came to be known as the Death Lineup, proved to be among the most effective units ever put together. The misconception about the lineup is that it is strictly an offensive ploy to run teams into the ground. While that is certainly a part of the equation, the lineup also features three tremendous defenders in Green, Iguodala and Thompson, and they are a nightmare on both ends of the court. Kerr tends to limit their minutes together to protect Green, who takes abuse from larger centers. Before Curry and Thompson went supernova and saved the Western Conference finals for the Warriors, the Thunder overwhelmed Golden State’s approach with the size and ferocious attitude of Steven Adams, Serge Ibaka, Enes Kanter and Kevin Durant. But the Cavaliers do not have the personnel to pull that off. Tristan Thompson is an undersize power forward who is expected to handle the bulk of the rebounding duties. Love, who is listed at   but was measured at   at the N. B. A. draft combine, is unlikely to be much of a threat inside against Green. The Cavaliers responded to the Death Lineup last season by essentially burying Timofey Mozgov on the bench, but they may want to give Mozgov, a Russian   a second look this time. The Warriors struggle with size, and Green is two technical fouls or one flagrant foul away from a mandatory suspension, meaning his typical strategy of physically assaulting opposing big men will not be in play. The Warriors beat the Cavaliers both times they played this season, but it was the second game, a brutal   shellacking, that might have cost  David Blatt his job as coach. In that game, Curry went off for 35 points, and Iguodala, the Cavaliers’ nemesis, had 20 points while shooting 7 for 8 and playing his typical stellar defense. If Blatt was fired for not being able to beat the Warriors, that is somewhat understandable. But it was certainly unusual to see a coach with an     record over two seasons fired midway through a campaign in which his team was on track to be the top seed in its conference. The University of Arizona may not be considered a typical N. B. A. feeder program, but this series is an excellent advertisement for what it produced in the Lute Olson era. The   Wildcats featured Luke Walton, the Warriors’ top assistant, along with Iguodala and Frye. Steve Kerr, the Warriors’ coach, was a   player at Arizona, teaming with Bruce Fraser, who in his capacity as Golden State’s   coach serves as Curry’s shot doctor. The Cavaliers’ Richard Jefferson joined Walton on the 2001 team that lost the national championship game to Duke, and Bret Brielmaier, a Cavaliers assistant, was a   player for the Wildcats. Both teams have efficient offenses, with a heavy reliance on  . The big difference between them is pace. The Warriors want to move as quickly as possible while the Cavaliers, regardless of what Coach Tyronn Lue may have wanted when he started coaching them, tend to grind out games at a snail’s pace. If Cleveland allows Golden State to dictate the speed of the game, the series could be a serious mismatch. The Warriors have a far deeper roster and are more balanced on the defensive side. While Klay Thompson, Green and Iguodala are likely to pose a defensive challenge to Irving, Love and James, it is hard to see anyone on the Cavaliers other than James being much of a threat to the Golden State offense. There is a path to victory for Cleveland that involves turning the series into a slugfest. The   Green is on thin ice with the league and can be temporarily removed as a threat by getting him to lash out just once. Thompson can also be drawn into foul trouble if Cleveland plays things correctly, and Golden State can be exploited with intentional fouls on Festus Ezeli, a comically bad   shooter. The problem, as so many teams have found out, is that the shooting of Curry and Thompson means that almost no lead is safe and that a team must press for all 48 minutes to secure a victory. It sounds simple enough, but Golden State’s record of   over the last two seasons, including the playoffs, indicates it is a daunting task.

0,WELFake Dataset,"I walked out of Tokyo Station, the big commuter hub in the city’s Chiyoda district, and turned to look up at its gorgeous brick facade. I was lost. I couldn’t find the Tokyo Station Hotel  —   a   luxury property that was renovated in 2012. My mistake, it turned out, was leaving the train station at all. The hotel and the train station coexist in one long, outstretched building, which was completed in 1914 and offers a refreshing prewar architectural counterpoint to the glittering    skyscrapers Tokyo is now known for. I looped back in and found the hotel’s lobby, as well as its chief concierge, Marie Antoinette Mori, who greeted me at her desk. Originally from the Philippines, Ms. Mori became fascinated with Japan during its big 1980s economic boom. She studied international tourism in Japan, married a Japanese man and began working in the hospitality industry, where her career took off. “I became one of the favorites of Mr. Stringer”  —   the former Sony chairman Howard Stringer. “I was the only one who wasn’t afraid of him,” she said with a laugh. Ms. Mori had prepared an itinerary for a fictitious guest, spending $1, 000 (about 110, 000 yen) over the course of a day in this   city. My goal was to remake the itinerary on a budget of $100  —   necessarily cutting a few corners, but hoping to retain the spirit of the original. HIGH Ms. Mori escorted me to the top floor of her hotel, into a huge room where sunlight flooded in through large skylights. Guests grazed on a large, comprehensive morning buffet. Ms. Mori recommended the Tokyo Station Hotel breakfast (3, 800 yen) where they could enjoy standard Western fare (eggs made to order, coffee, pastries) or regional Japanese staples, where the Tokyo Station really excels:   (hot pot from the northern Hokkaido region) traditional rice porridge, soybean milk skin, and boiled rape blossoms. Ms. Mori said many luxury hotels in the area had comparable buffets. The   she said, specializes in pastries. “Over there they have a, uh   …     what do you call it?” she asked. “A Cronut. ” LOW From one buffet in a huge train station to another, I went to the considerably cheaper Bar Marche Kodama in the Shinagawa train station in the Minato ward. It’s also a little tricky to find: Don’t exit the station once you get off at the Shinagawa stop. Go into the Ecute department store and you’ll find the small restaurant in the back corner. Once there, I feasted on an eclectic, mostly   buffet of prosciutto, green salad, fresh corn, pasta Bolognese, crispy fried rice and, for dessert, Italian wedding cookies. The inclusion of the salad was particularly nice  —   Japanese cuisine is healthy, but not necessarily heavy on raw, leafy greens. Total cost: 620 yen. HIGH Ms. Mori quoted a price of roughly 15, 000 yen to have a private sedan with a driver for three hours to ferry our faux   around the city. The Tokyo Station Hotel goes so far as to meet guests at train platforms and escort them to the hotel  —   a service that comes only with staying at the hotel, of course, which can run over $1, 000 per night. LOW Logistics are tricky for those unfamiliar with the city. Get to know and love the train, because you’ll be spending quite a bit of time with it. Tokyo’s system is expansive and can be, in a word, daunting. There are over 100 different railway lines in Tokyo, and most of them are privately held by competing companies. The two big ones you’ll need to know are JR East, the largest railway system in Japan, and the Tokyo Metro, the city’s busiest subway system. If you’re planning to use only the subway or JR lines, there are passes for that. A combination ticket, though (which can be purchased in JR stations) is the better way to go. For 1, 590 yen, you’ll be able to use several lines for one day, including all of Tokyo’s JR lines and the Tokyo Metro. Another option is to buy a Suica or Pasmo card (available at ticket vending machines in major train stations) reusable cards on which you load money you touch them to the turnstile each time you ride. There is a   deposit to pick up one of those cards, but it’s worth it  —   you won’t have to deal with individual tickets, you’ll get a small discount on rides and you can even use it to make purchases in some stores and at the city’s ubiquitous vending machines. Related pro tip Get a SIM card for your phone  —   data only. You won’t want to be without a maps app when you’re walking around. Cards in the $15 to $20 range are widely available. (Make sure you get the right size: the   iPhones, for example, use nano SIM cards, not micro SIM.) HIGH The Asakusa neighborhood is known for its Sensoji Buddhist temple, Tokyo’s oldest. Ms. Mori recommended a rickshaw tour of the neighborhood, passing along Sumida Park, one of the many places in Tokyo to see sakura, or cherry blossoms, in the early spring. A   tour costs 16, 250 yen. LOW I set out to do some exploring on my own, and see some sakura in the process. A follower of the Frugal Traveler Twitter account recommended the Nezu Museum in the Minato district. While the Nezu’s collection of Buddhist art and Chinese bronzes was interesting, I was most impressed with the lush garden out back. The garden  —   about four acres  —   is shockingly big in a place where space is so precious. It truly feels like an escape from the city. Admission was 1, 000 yen. From there, I hopped a couple of trains over to the Korakuen station and walked up to the University of Tokyo’s Koishikawa Botanical Gardens. After paying admission (400 yen) I headed from the southeast entrance to a huge open expanse in the center of the garden. I found families picnicking, children playing and people lining up for coffee and tea from the ramshackle snack bar called Coffee Time (a coffee is 300 yen). All were enjoying the budding cherry blossoms and cool spring weather. HIGH Ms. Mori recommended the omakase tasting menu at  —   where else?  —   Sukiyabashi Jiro. The    sushi master Jiro Ono’s already formidable status was made outright legendary with the release of the 2012 documentary “Jiro Dreams of Sushi. ” The   restaurant is difficult to get into, but Ms. Mori can make the arrangements. “We can get you into Jiro,” she said, “but then you have to go. You have to. We can’t have   at Jiro. ” The price for lunch (or dinner) is 30, 000 yen. LOW Jiro received three Michelin stars Tsuta received one. It was the first Japanese ramen shop ever to receive such an honor. The small, unassuming space, close to the Sugamo station on the JR Yamanote line, is difficult to get into for different reasons: They take no reservations and operate on a ticket system. I went early one morning, around 7:30 a. m. and waited outside the restaurant with a handful of other people. Eventually the door slid open and a man came out with a handful of small, laminated tickets. He handed me one: “Come back,” he said. “Between 12 and 1 p. m. ” He took a   bill as a deposit, then went back inside and closed the door. When I returned at noon, I was treated to the best bowl of shoyu (soy  ) ramen I’d ever eaten. The broth was deep, intense and slightly sweet. The accompaniments  —     egg, bamboo shoots and pork slices  —   were done perfectly. The basic ramen bowl at Tsuta is 950 yen  —   I paid a total of 1, 250 for three extra slices of pork. HIGH Who doesn’t like a little costume play built into their vacations? Ms. Mori recommended something called a “kimono experience and photo shoot,” wherein the patron pays for elaborate kimono dress (in one of several styles: oiran, maiko or geisha) as well as hair and makeup. A photo shoot follows. Men, don’t think you’re getting out of this: There’s a samurai option for you. The oiran set with two kimonos costs 27, 000 yen. LOW I found a different way to incorporate both ceremonial clothing (of sorts) and culture into my visit: taking in a Japanese baseball game. I bought my ticket at one of the many   in Japan. (  is owned by a Japanese company.) It was a complicated process, one that involved a helpful clerk trying to spell my name in the Japanese alphabet  —   buying at the stadium probably would have been easier. It also involved deciding what “cheering section” I wanted to sit in. I decided on an outfield ticket on the side of the home team, the Tokyo Yakult Swallows. The game was positively raucous  —   at one point, everyone in my section produced tiny umbrellas and began thrusting them up and down and chanting (a   chant, I assumed) while a small brass band backed them up. The stadium grub selection was great, too  —   a big bowl of ramen could be had for 750 yen, yakitori for 100 yen, and a whiskey and melon soda for 600 yen. My ticket cost a reasonable 1, 800 yen. HIGH Seiji Yamamoto is the chef at Nihonryori RyuGin, a modern kaiseki restaurant that was awarded three Michelin stars. Mr. Yamamoto is known for incorporating modern culinary techniques with the refined, traditional kaiseki dinner. The descriptions of RyuGin’s courses are wonderfully abstract: Dishes have names like “Coolness Warmth Playfulness Nostalgia and Temptation” and “A Message From the Coast of Japan. ” Dinner costs 27, 000 yen. LOW I was also in search of a taste of the coast of Japan, in the form of a sushi dinner. I met up with my friend Mayumi, a Tokyo native, and presented her with my annoyingly specific parameters: something good but not that good cheap but definitely not poor quality. She   took me to a small place near the Kyodo train station in her neighborhood, about a   ride from Shinjuku: Midori Sushi, an unpretentious restaurant next to a KFC. The chef Ken Hosono’s   omakase menu featured an exceptionally   squid, along with barracuda, fatty tuna, uni and a wonderfully buttery scallop, among other pieces. The cost was 3, 000 yen per person. Not only was it one of best sushi dinners I’ve had in recent memory, but it was among the cheapest  —   a    sweet spot that every frugal traveler seeks out.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Thank goodness these Muslim women have a friend in socialist, radical Mayor of New York City An NYPD officer pretended to be a Brooklyn College student at the Islamic Society in New York City, and taking the Muslim oath of faith, before befriending Muslim students to infiltrate the community.The woman, who went by the name of Mel, short for Melike, spent four years earning the trust of Islamic students at the college as part of an NYPD operation to spy on Muslims, according to NY s daily weblog Gothamist.The controversial mission was part of the police departments well-documented plan that sees the blanket surveillance of innocent Muslims.The Mayor of New York, Bill deBlasio has openly criticized such surveillance and declared at a Ramadan dinner that Muslim New Yorkers were  still fighting for basic human rights. Watch Mayor DeBlasio defend Muslim women with ties to Al Qaeda here: We recently shut down the Demographics Unit at NYPD, which conducted surveillance on Muslim New Yorkers. Because it s unfair to single out people on the sole basis of their religion,  he added. The undercover operation led to some important arrests. Four years after Mel had infiltrated the college, two Queens residents, Noelle Velentzas and Asia Siddiqui, were arrested and charged with allegedly planning to build a bomb.The US Justice Department issued a release stating that the women were linked to members of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State.Many of the cases dealt with by the NYPD often involve a form of  entrapment  that see undercover detectives and FBI informants carrying out manipulative tactics in order to secure evidence that will later lead to arrests.In the case of Velentzas and Siddiqui, four propane gas tanks, as well as instructions for how to turn them into explosive devices, are said to have been found in Siddiqui s home, and according to the criminal complaint, the two women had in-depth conversations with the undercover officer about their violent aspirations.The undercover officer established a friendship with at least one of the women as early as 2013, according to the criminal complaint.The two women are not alleged to have been in the process of planning a specific attack, and according to the criminal complaint, Velentzas repeatedly stated she would not want to harm any  regular  people, instead targeting police or military personnel.After 9/11, both the NYPD and the FBI revamped their approach to terrorism investigations and began operating under a policy of preventive prosecution.The NYPD began to look for particular indicators of radicalization such as the  wearing of traditional Islamic clothing,  giving up drinking or smoking, and  becoming involved in social activism. In the NYPD s model of measuring threats, which have been criticized, young people were also a key target. The government   often acting through informants   is actively involved in developing [terrorism plots], persuading and sometimes pressuring the target to participate, and providing the resources to carry it out,  according to the 2014 Human Rights Watch report. Brooklyn College students at the Islamic Society told Gothamist they feel skeptical and paranoid. In the back of all our minds, there s always that suspicion, that either, you are a spy, or you think I m one,  a female Muslim student stressed.

0,WELFake Dataset,"THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS PUSHING FOLKS OFF OF TRANS FATS I should say  nudge  because that s the favorite term of the liberals. We all know it s really a shove to do what they mandate. It s doubtful trans fats in small quantities will be devastating to anyone. The taste and texture of foods like donuts will change. Will be start to have underground donut shops that are made with banned trans fats? The food police are making DAMN sure you conform to their mandate but isn t palm oil just as bad? The Obama administration is expected to all but ban trans fat in a final ruling that could drop as soon as next week, killing most uses of an ingredient that has been put in everything from frozen pizza to Reese s Pieces but since deemed harmful to human health.The agency may create some very limited exemptions, but the ruling could force food companies to cut trans fat use beyond the 85 percent reduction already achieved over the past decade   a key piece of the Obama administration s broader agenda to nudge Americans toward a healthier diet.The food industry believes low-levels of trans fats are safe. Industry leaders have banded together behind-the-scenes to craft a food additive petition that will ask FDA to allow some uses of partially hydrogenated oils, such as in the sprinkles on cupcakes, cookies and ice cream. The industry hasn t shared details, but officials maintain the uses will represent  very limited amounts.  For more than 60 years, partially hydrogenated oils have been used in food products under the status generally recognized as safe, which does not require FDA s approval. But since the 1990s, reams of studies have linked trans fat consumption to cardiovascular disease, causing somewhere between 30,000 and 100,000 premature deaths before the industry started phasing it out.In late 2013 the Obama administration issued a tentative determination that partially hydrogenated oils are not generally recognized as safe. The move sent shock waves through the food industry, which has already brought down average consumption from more than 4 grams per day to about 1 gram per day   an exodus largely fueled by mandatory labeling imposed a decade ago. Scores of popular products, including Oreos and Cheetos, have quietly dropped partially hydrogenated oils over the years, but it remains an ingredient in many products, including Pop Secret microwave popcorn, Pillsbury Grands! Cinnamon Rolls and Sara Lee cheesecake, as well as some restaurant fryers and commercial bakery goods. If FDA sticks to its guns in its final determination   and most in food policy circles assume it will   the agency will be taking a firm step toward pushing out more of the remaining uses of trans fat.

He complains that he s been treated very unfairly by any media outlet that doesn t immediately shove its head up his ass, and he bans outlets he deems to be too dishonest and unfair to have the privilege of covering him.Not once has he ever actually laid out what is  fair. But, thanks to his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, we now have a definition for  fair  reporting. But watch out, it s pretty ridiculous: What  fairly  means is you don t editorialize, you report what he says, that s fair. If you look at the story that he did in The New York Times on foreign policy, it was literally the transcript of what he said it wasn t editorialized at all. That s fair reporting. That was in response to Don Lemon saying that Trump is bashing CNN for repeating what he says and fact-checking it. So, basically,  fair  is no fact-checking, no discussion, just his words. Nothing else.All that does is give Trump a license to say what he wants, because then he knows the media won t call him on it. Of course, that s exactly what he wants to have happen. He wants everyone to believe him, to trust him implicitly, even though he s lying through his teeth. A huge part of his hatred toward the media is their penchant for fact-checking him, and proving him false.This is the most laughable definition of  fair  reporting imaginable.Watch a video of this below, beginning at about the 3:20 mark:Just now on @CNNTonight: some frank talk about Trump & the media with @CLewandowski_ & @DonLemonhttps://t.co/OJk77DpOvl  Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) August 17, 2016Featured image by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomb attack in the Afghan capital near a meeting of supporters of an influential regional leader on Thursday killed at least nine people and wounded many, the interior ministry said. Islamic State claimed responsibility, according to Amaq, its official news agency. The Taliban denied involvement. Atta Mohammad Noor, governor of the northern province of Balkh and a leader of the mainly ethnic Tajik Jamiat-i-Islami party, was not at the meeting at the time of the attack, members of the party said. Political tensions are rising as politicians have begun jockeying for position ahead of presidential elections expected in 2019 and thousands of civilians have been killed in attacks this year.  The bomber approached the hotel hosting the gathering on foot but was spotted by a police official, Sayed Basam Padshah, as he neared a security checkpoint, an interior ministry spokesman said. The attacker triggered his explosives vest before he could get any further, Kabul police chief Basir Mujahid told Reuters. Padshah was among the seven policemen and two civilians killed.  He saved many lives by sacrificing his life,  Mujahid said. The northern-based Jamiat-i-Islami was for years the main opponent of the Taliban, who draw their support largely from the southern-based ethnic Pashtun community. A witness to Thursday s bombing said:  We are proud to be martyred because of our country and our rights. This gathering was for the sake of our country to raise our voice.  In June, a suicide bomber attacked a meeting of Jamiat-i-Islami leaders, including Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah. Abdullah, who is supported by ethnic minority leaders including Noor who fought against the Taliban s hard-line Islamist regime in the 1990s, formed a coalition government with President Ashraf Ghani after a disputed 2014 presidential election. Ghani on Wednesday sacked the chairman of the Independent Election Commission, raising doubts over whether parliamentary and council ballots scheduled for next year will take place as planned.

It s also pretty common knowledge who s calling the shots at the White House. If Valerie doesn t want Hillary to be coronated as the next Democratic Presidential candidate, it s highly likely that in the dirty world of Obama s Chicago thug style politics that Hillary s not gonna be the candidate The lady in waiting will have to keep waiting. Probably forever. Fate has spoken.Already threatened by a growing trust deficit with voters, her would-be majesty now faces an even more lethal adversary. It s called the truth, though she probably sees it as a vast, left-wing conspiracy.The news that two inspectors general from the Obama administration want the Justice Department to investigate her handling of classified material is a potential game changer. For many Democrats, it will serve as final proof she is  fatally flawed. Her standing will further erode, turning her coronation plans into a long, hot summer. The drip, drip, drip of details will produce new polls showing a bleeding of support, which will entice other candidates into the race. Look for Vice President Joe Biden to jump in soon, and lefty Sen. Elizabeth Warren might also take the leap.Meanwhile, Clinton must play  defense against her former colleagues in the State Department and intelligence agencies. Actually, it s worse. She s almost certainly up against the White House.Somebody very high in the food chain leaked the memos requesting the probe. The New York Times, which broke the story, identified its source only as  a senior government official.  My money is on Valerie Jarrett, the Obamas  Rasputin, who is known to despise Clinton. If it was Jarrett, she would not do this against the president s wishes.That also would be true for any  senior government official  who leaked the memos. Targets don t get any bigger than Hillary Clinton, so this was not a rogue operation. This was an approved hit.Clinton has an enemies list   and it looks like she s on Obama s. It s also possible the White House is  using the issue to keep her in line on the Iranian nuke deal. The implied threat is  look what happened to Robert Menendez. Either way, she had it coming. Her arrogance and bald-faced lies about the emails must have infuriated her boss and colleagues. Her decision to conduct government business on a private server in her home and use personal email accounts was a giant  f k you  to the administration.When it was revealed in March that she had deleted tens of thousands of emails before turning over those she deemed government property, she compounded injury with an insulting insistence that she did nothing wrong. Insiders knew that was a big fat lie.As I wrote then, Clinton s claim that she acted out of  convenience  was hogwash. She wanted to keep her correspondence secret from Congress, the media   and also from the White House, and the people it stashed at State to watch her. It s obvious now she underestimated the ammunition she was providing. As a result, she has put her dream of being the second President Clinton in mortal jeopardy.And her problems may not end with the classified issue. Any honest prosecutor looking at her emails would also look for evidence she traded government favors for contributions to the Clinton Foundation or paid speeches.She and Bill Clinton were paid $25 million for speeches in just 16 months, and some of that cash came from donors and companies with business before her.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter We are having a New Moon in Scorpio on October 30th in most places around the world, and during the early hours of October 31st in Australia and New Zealand. It will occur at 5:38pm Universal Time ( click here for your time zone).   New Moons bring in a new wave of energy for the upcoming month. It is the beginning of the first half of the lunar cycle, which is when the Moon is waxing (gaining light), while the Full Moon is the transition into the second half, when the Moon is waning (losing light). Therefore, the energy of the New Moon serves as more of a guidepost for those first 10-14 days of the cycle. Scorpio: Powerful, Deep, Intense, and Passionate Scorpio is a primal and passionate sign about desires, fears, and intensity. As a ‘fixed sign’ ruled by Mars and Pluto, it holds a high concentration of power that can be used to control or to transform. It likes and seeks what is real and refrains from anything that is lacking substance. The deep merging of two individuals or parties, whether it be sexually, financially, or resourcefully, is Scorpio territory. This sign seeks loyalty, yet it must be earned after a period of being under scrutiny. It wants to know what is hidden beneath the surface to decide on how much trust is to be earned. Scorpio is about being willing to look at and even embrace the deepest, darkest, and scariest aspects of others, oneself, and the world around us. It is the sign of death and rebirth, love and hate, as it is the sign of extremes. An example of all of this is how we have Halloween followed by ‘All Saints Day’, and then followed by ‘All Souls Day’ back to back during Scorpio season. The shadow side of Scorpio is that it can be manipulative and controlling in a very calculated way. While the scrutinizing of others is to gain trust, it can also be about getting some sort of advantage to have more control over a person or situation. Although Scorpio seeks hidden aspects of others, it can be very guarded about one’s own secrets.   New Moon Conjunct Mercury and Trine Neptune Mercury is also in Scorpio moving away from a conjunction with the Sun that was exact 3 days before on October 27th. In the days leading up to this New Moon, many people could have experienced important communications, ideas, deep thoughts, or some sort of mental efforts towards joint resources/efforts, money, sexuality, and/or some sort of strategy. Whatever it is, think of it as something that has been ‘gathered’ or ‘set-up’ to be implemented or expanded on in this moon cycle and in the coming months. The New Moon (with Mercury separating) is also in a trine with Neptune, which could assist us with our imagination, creativity, intuition, dreams, visions, and spiritual connection. Due to the nodes also being involved, there may also be a connection with how our past can help our future. For some lovers, it can be a time of feeling like soulmates. This energy is strong until November 2nd. Venus Conjunct Saturn, Mars In Capricorn Square Uranus The day before the New Moon, Venus made a conjunction with Saturn, which initiated a new 14 month cycle between the two. Venus is about fun, love, relationships, beauty, and pleasure while Saturn is serious and more concerned with responsibilities, structure, discipline, and commitments. Therefore, many of us will experience some sort of merging of these themes both in either favourable or unfavourable ways. Occurring in Sagittarius, it can be related to our beliefs, visions, travel, education, publishing, or marketing. Mars, a ruler of Scorpio, has been in the ambitious sign of Capricorn since September 27th. This has been an excellent time to really make things happen in terms of reaching our goals, and it will last until November 8th/9th. During this New Moon, Mars is separating from a square with Uranus which was stronger in the 2 days prior. At worst, their could have been sudden change, separation, instability, and the need to take some sort of action as a result. For some people, it could have of been rebellion or wanting to break free from a controlling situation. In other cases it could of positively brought innovation towards our ambitions. These are just some examples of how it could be manifested, but whatever it is for each of us, it has created the landscape for some new beginnings. Mercury and Sun Sextile Pluto, Venus Trine Uranus During the first week of the Moon cycle, Mercury (followed by the Sun) will be in a harmonious aspect with Pluto in Capricorn. Pluto, being the modern ruler of Scorpio, indicates that this is an excellent time to expand on what was initiated during the previous week when Mercury was conjunct the Sun. Powerful thoughts, communication, or deep research to assist us in our careers, managing or earning resources/money, or implementing some sort of structure or strategy to help gain some of sort of success and fulfill a goal. Venus is trine Uranus and will be strongest on November 4th-5th. This can be a fun and exciting time, and luckily it will fall on the weekend. This is a great time to connect with people, attend social events, especially since Venus is in Sagittarius, it is a good time to explore and try new things that can bring you enjoyment. This can be a great time for lovers as well with potential breakthroughs. Things To Consider And Making Intentions For This New Moon Look at everything that has played out for you in the last week prior to this New Moon. The next 10 days following it is a significant time to make a great effort to expand on what has been initiated, and take steps to move beyond anything challenging that has occurred. Your intentions for this Lunar Month should be related to improving on and/or facilitating the positive qualities of Scorpio energy into your life. This includes (but not limited to) improving your ability to earn or manage money/resources, tapping into and harnessing your inner power and sexual energy better, facing your fears, trying to understand complex things, seeing beyond fakeness or deceit, and becoming more in touch with what is real. The best time to make your intentions for the Moon cycle is during the first 24 hours following the New Moon but it could even be done within the first 3 days. The closer to the New Moon, the better.

0,WELFake Dataset,"When President Trump signed an executive order last month temporarily barring visitors from seven mostly Muslim countries, he said he was moving to protect the United States from terrorist attacks. The Homeland Security secretary, John F. Kelly, echoed the president, saying the travel ban was necessary because vetting procedures “in those seven countries are suspect. ” But an internal report written by intelligence analysts at Mr. Kelly’s department appears to undercut the assessment that people from the seven countries  —   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  —   pose a heightened threat of terrorism. The   report found that “country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity. ” The report adds to the difficulties the Trump administration has faced in carrying out the travel ban. Federal judges have suspended the order, and the administration has said it will redo it to withstand legal scrutiny, but has not given a timetable. The Department of Homeland Security assessment, first reported by The Associated Press, found that only a small number of people from the seven countries had been involved in   activities in the United States since the Syrian civil war began in 2011. In addition, the report noted, while terrorist groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen pose a threat to the United States, militant groups in the other four countries have a more regional focus. The report also found that in the past six years, the terrorism threat reached much more widely than the seven countries listed  —   individuals from 26 countries had been “inspired” to carry out attacks in the United States. Furthermore, few individuals from the seven countries affected by the ban have access to the United States, the report said, noting the small numbers of visas granted by the State Department to citizens of those nations. The White House and the Department of Homeland Security sought to play down the significance of the report. The White House said that it was politically motivated and disregarded information that would have provided support for the travel ban. The Department of Homeland Security said the report was just a draft and “not a final comprehensive review of the government’s intelligence. ” Stephen Miller, a senior aide to Mr. Trump, told Fox News on Tuesday that the redrawn executive order would “have the same basic policy outcome. ” The Trump administration on Friday also took the first steps toward following through on the president’s plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico. Customs and Border Protection, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, announced that it would begin accepting design proposals for a wall. The agency said it would need the proposals by March 10. After it chooses a list of potential vendors, full proposals would be required a few weeks later.

In what is shaping up to be the beginning of a revolution within the United States, residents from California and now Oregon are wanting to secede from the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected President…and they want Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Washington state to join them to create an entirely new country altogether. 
Two days after the Trump election in the U.S. residents in California began a campaign called “ Yes California Independence Campaign ,” which is to initiate the process to officially secede from the U.S. California residents are pushing for secession. 
Ruiz Evans said Yes California intends to launch an initiative that asks Californians whether they believe the state should remain part of the United States or break away on its own. Similar to the Citizens United ballot measure voters approved Tuesday, it would begin as an advisory proposal to kick-start an arduous process. Marcus Ruiz Evans is the vice president of the group and s aid that Californians have a choice : 
“The reason that we’re here today is we wanted to point out to everybody in California that the American system is broken. It’s failing. It’s sinking. You as a Californian have a choice to make: Do you go down with that ship out of tradition or sail on your own?” 
Their website states that Californians should follow Brexit’s lead: In our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children. However, this independence referendum is about more than California subsidizing other states of this country. It is about the right to self-determination and the concept of voluntary association, both of which are supported by constitutional and international law. In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the international community with their “Brexit” vote. Our “Calexit” referendum is about California joining the international community. You have a big decision to make. To add to Calexit’s momentum, an Oregon lawyer has joined the movement and filed the Oregon Secession Act , which has formally invited the states of California, Alaska, Washington, Hawaii and Nevada to secede with them and form a new nation together. The Act was filed by lawyer Jennifer Rollins and writer Christian Trejbal, who said that Oregonian values are no longer the values held by the rest of the United States and that joining with these other states to create a new nation “is a viable way to go forward.” However, just 24 hours after the Act was filed, they withdrew it due to the amount of violence they saw in the streets around the world. Trejbal said that they were receiving death threats and that their movement is not about violent protesting, so it was best to withdraw it at this time. Though Oregon has suspended their secession campaign for now, California’s campaign is growing stronger. With Texas speaking of secession just months ago, we now have the most populated state in the U.S. speaking of secession as well. Regardless of one’s political stance, it is clear to see that the people are growing restless and that something is going to have to give, and give soon. How do you see this playing out? Will California be able to secede and will other states join them? Will the U.S. Congress allow something like this to happen? Will revolution be the result?

0,WELFake Dataset,"Newsflash for Mattel, and any other company who is pandering to the Left this Christmas season: God did not create Gender-Neutral beings God made man and woman to be different for a reason Don t mess with God A boy is featured in the latest Barbie commercial for the first time ever. The commercial is receiving widespread praise for upending gender barriers. The ad displays Mattel s new line of Barbie dolls created as part of a partnership with the Italian fashion house Moschino. The dolls sport outfits of black mesh and leather, with edgy golden accessories to match.However, it is not the dolls  racy clothing that steals the show, but rather, the mohawked boy playing with the dolls.  Moschino Barbie is so fierce,  he exclaims to the camera with an exaggerated head roll. This single line is garnering the Barbie boy a huge fan base worldwide.The public now accepts homosexuality and same-sex  marriage.  But the fight is not over. The offensive to reshape society in even more radical ways pushes forward.An effort is gaining ground to create a world where not just  sexual orientation,  but sex itself, is a choice. Where boys can be girls and girls can be boys, or something in between. Where people are expected to ignore the biological reality of sex so that all people coexist androgynously, or according to whatever gender suits them at the moment. Where everyone pretends that gender confusion is normal, if not desirable, and anyone who doesn t play along can be punished and silenced.This demonstrates unprecedented contempt for reality and common sense, let alone morality.Think of the implications with respect to public bathrooms, sex-segregated activities, locker rooms, college student housing and countless other areas of human interaction.Does the idea of a boy who thinks he s a girl showering next to your daughter in P.E. class make you uncomfortable? Then you d better brace yourself. This cause is winning critical legal battles and it is starting with our youth.Earlier this month, the California Senate passed a bill saying that throughout K-12 education, a student is  permitted to participate in sex-segregated school programs and activities, including athletic teams and competitions, and use facilities [e.g. bathrooms, locker rooms] consistent with his or her gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil s records.   Gender identity  is the terminology these ultrasensitive, morally sophisticated lawmakers use to refer to the sex a person happens to identify with.Last month, a governing body in Colorado ruled that a 6-year-old boy who thinks he s a girl has the right to use the girl s bathroom at his elementary school. The Colorado Division of Civil Rights said that denying him that right  creates an environment rife with harassment  and is akin to racial segregation.See where this is going? The public majority already agrees that denying same-sex couples the right to  marry  is exactly like prohibiting interracial marriage. Now, denying someone access to a public bathroom on the basis of biology is just like excluding blacks from white-only facilities.These lawmakers and officials are determined to ensure that these children grow up in a world where sex confusion is welcomed, even encouraged.What about the girl who feels awkward about having a boy walk in while she s using the bathroom? Sorry. She is the one who needs to adjust her thinking not the boy.But there is something far more sinister going on here. Mattel is not just using the ad to connect with little boys who play with Barbie dolls; it is using the ad to smash gender roles.It s no secret that society is moving away from gender-based toys for children. Target is in the process of removing gender-based signs from their toy section, and Hasbro switched to a gender-neutral Easy-Bake Oven a few years ago.The Moschino Barbie commercial is just another step in society s pursuit to radically change social expectations.

Профессор американского университета Аллан Личман сообщил о предчувствии того, что Трампу будет объявлен импичмент. 
Издревле человек хотел заглянуть в будущее. Заманчиво ведь — заранее знать, успешной ли будет охота, кто станет вождём племени, чем обернётся поход за рабами, и насколько стоит придерживать язык в личной беседе с императором. А поскольку заглянуть в будущее человек не может, ну, не может, хоть тресни, приходится уповать на различные знаки. Можно сказать, знаки судьбы. 
Знаки эти, как понимаете, совершенно разные. Это уже позже появились гадальные карты, просто игральные карты и карты Таро. Раньше-то всё было попроще. То баранья лопатка, то потроха чёрного петуха, то полёт птиц. Короче, всё, что нас окружает, обладает предикторскими* свойствами. Достаточно подробно и обоснованно всё это описано, ну, хотя бы, Фрезером в книге «Золотая ветвь». (Предупреждаю заранее, «многа букафф», можно «ниасилить»). 
А уж как эти свойства интерпретировать знают нужные люди. Подчёркиваю, знают! Во всяком случае, по их словам, звучащим крайне убедительно для них самих. Помните диалог Бендера с ксёндзами? — Эй, вы, херувимы и серафимы,— сказал Остап, вызывая врагов на диспут, — бога нет! … — Как же вы утверждаете, что бога нет, — начал Алоизий Морошек задушевным голосом, — когда всё живое создано им… 
Ну, вы же понимаете, что этот диалог несколько не по теме, но уровень компетенции интерпретаторов знаков судьбы примерно одинаков, разница только в интеллектуальном уровне «научного» обоснования предсказания, основанного на предикторских свойствах кофейной гущи или от запутанности кренделей, выписываемых ногами обезглавленной курицы. 
Но вернёмся в наши времена. Думается, предсказателей и гадалок (гадателей) меньше не стало, поэтому кое-кто стал больше доверять животным. Один осьминог Пауль чего стоит, правильно предсказавший результаты 4 из 6 матчей сборной Германии на Евро-2008. Но футбол футболом, а победу Дональда Трампа на президентских выборах напророчили кливлендские собаки-предсказатели, китайская мартышка Геда, российский белый медведь Феликс и российская же черепашка-предсказательница Ася. 
Но мы – люди. Не можем мы в своих прогнозах уповать на безмозглых животных. Прошу прощения у защитников животного мира – слово «безмозглые» употреблено, конечно же в фигуральном смысле. Так вот, несмотря на обилие удачных предсказаний, гм, братьев наших меньших, опираться нужно всё-таки на более разумные аргументы. Аргументы политологов, аналитиков, и как они там ещё называются. Но, надо заметить, что этой братии развелось не меньше, чем профессиональных гадалок и чревовещателей, простите, предсказателей. 
Возьмём, к примеру, эксперта по проведению опросов общественного мнения Сэма Ванга из Принстонского университета. Правда, этот аналитик, пророча победу Хиллари Клинтон, ошибся. Но зато сдержал слово и прямо в эфире телеканала CNN съел сверчка. Съел, как честный человек, пообещавший сделать это в случае ошибки. Много ли вы наблюдали людей, пообещавших в случае ошибки съесть собственную шляпу или галстук, и сдержавших слово? 
Но есть и аналитики, не ошибающиеся в своих прогнозах. Именно таков профессор Американского университета Аллан Личман. Он создал систему предсказания исхода выборов, которая не давала сбоев с 1984 года! Девять раз подряд, основываясь на своём специальном методе анализа, он безошибочно предсказывал, кто станет президентом США. Именно Аллан Личман ещё в сентябре, за два месяца до президентских выборов, практически со 100%-ой уверенностью заявил, что следующим президентом станет Дональд Трамп. Вот это дар предвидения, точнее, вот это система анализа! 
И вот теперь, сразу же после выборов, этот же аналитик заявляет, что теперь он ожидает отставки или импичмента того же Трампа! Не странно ли? И, что интересно, теперь профессор основывается не на своей сверхпророческой системе, а на простой человеческой интуиции. Давая интервью Washington Post, эксперт заявил, что, давая прогноз об импичменте Трампа, он руководствовался не методом, при помощи которого определял, кто станет главой США, а «внутренними ощущениями». Ой ли? Правда, Личман попытался хоть как-то аргументировать своё мнение: «Они (республиканцы – прим. ред.) не хотят Трампа президентом, потому что они не могут его контролировать, он непредсказуем. Они бы с радостью хотели видеть на этой должности Майкла Пенса – полностью прямолинейного, консервативного и контролируемого республиканца». Не лукавит ли аналитик? Если не республиканцы выдвинули кандидатуру Трампа, то кто? 
А, может быть, профессор знает немного больше, чем говорит? А, может быть, профессор знает намного больше, чем говорит? А, может быть, пришла пора применить внутри страны методики, разработанные для внешнего использования? Я имею в виду методики бархатных, цветочных и прочих плодово-ягодных революций. Подумайте, я просто хочу зажечь искорку сомнения. 
Между тем, волнения, вызванные победой Трампа, не утихают, даже ширятся. Не так ли всё начиналось и в странах, где, казалось бы, спонтанно, вдруг, вспыхивали протесты против итогов президентских выбров? Не начинает ли чудовище Франкенштейна оборачиваться против своего создателя? Подумайте, я просто хочу зажечь искорку сомнения.

0,WELFake Dataset,"ISTANBUL  —   For almost two years, Syrian Kurds, with American weapons, air cover and training, have fought and died in battle against the Islamic State. They have taken pride in their status as the United States’ most faithful proxy in the fight against the militant group, and they have hoped their effectiveness as warriors would lead to American support for Kurdish political gains inside Syria. So, many Kurds shuddered when Turkish tanks and soldiers recently rolled into northern Syria, with American support, to push back against Kurdish gains. They saw it, perhaps prematurely, as a replay of a century of betrayal by world powers, going back to the end of World War I, when they were promised, then denied, their own state in the postwar settlement. “The Kurds are going to scream betrayal at every turn when they think things are not going to go their way, because they’ve had a century of it,” said Joost Hiltermann, the program director for the Middle East and North Africa at the International Crisis Group, and a longtime expert on the Kurds. The Syrian Kurds say their aim is to establish an autonomous region, not their own state, where their rights are protected, in whatever settlement comes from the long Syrian civil war. And they say they hope that the United States will support them in that desire. To accomplish that, though, they need to connect two of their territories: Afrin, in the west, and Kobani, in the east, an effort that Turkey sees as a national security threat to be thwarted at virtually any cost. So, while the first aim of Turkey’s incursion last month into northern Syria was to push the Islamic State from the border town of Jarabulus, many believe Turkey’s primary goal was to thwart Kurdish territorial ambitions. That the United States supported the move by Turkey, a NATO ally, reverberated among ethnic Kurds across the region, where they are spread across four countries  —   Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey  —   and have long dreamed of their own state, while being oppressed by autocratic governments that have denied them basic political rights. “These operations by Turkey are obviously more against the Kurds than Daesh,” said Mahmoud Othman, a prominent Iraqi Kurdish politician, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. He added: “People are afraid now. People are really afraid of what could happen in the end. ” Drawing on history, Kurds see themselves as the playthings of world powers, used in proxy fights when it serves someone’s interest and then discarded. The United States, on balance, has arguably been a great friend to the Kurds, coming to their aid after the Persian Gulf war in the early 1990s and helping to establish an autonomous region for them in Iraq, safe from Saddam Hussein’s brutality. However, the United States also figures prominently in that historical memory of betrayal. In 1975, after the C. I. A. worked with Iran to supply weapons to the Kurds to fight Mr. Hussein’s regime, Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger abruptly pulled the plug after a reconciliation between Tehran and Baghdad. “In 1975, the same betrayal of the Kurds happened,” said Hasos Hard, a Kurdish journalist in northern Iraq, when asked about his reaction to the American support for Turkey’s Syria incursion. Many analysts, though, as well as Syrian Kurdish fighters on the ground, say the accusations of betrayal are not quite right  —   at least not yet. There is little sign that the United States has abandoned the Syrian Kurds. American officials have worked to negotiate a truce on the ground between the rebels backed by Turkey and the Kurdish militia, known as the People’s Protection Units, and fighting has calmed in recent days. But many Kurds say they now see the writing on the wall and worry that once the Islamic State is driven from its capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the United States will sell them out. Mr. Hiltermann said that when he traveled to northern Syria this year, he was asked this question, over and over, by the Kurds: “What do you think the Americans will do when Raqqa is taken?” The question highlights the conundrum that the increasingly complicated Syrian battlefield presents the United States, which has tried to balance its relations with Turkey and the Syrian Kurds  —   a primary Turkish enemy because of their ties to militants inside the country. Even though the United States has funneled weapons to the Syrian Kurds and provided them with military training, it has not established ties to the militia’s political wing, the Democratic Union Party, because of Turkish concerns. Nor has it promised them anything beyond military support in the fight against the Islamic State, other than expressions of support for a Kurdish role at the negotiating table when, or if, serious peace talks get underway. Aliza Marcus, an author and expert on the Kurds, said, “It seems crass by the U. S. ” to provide military support without any steps to establish political ties. This seems especially true now, she said, after the Kurds took heavy casualties in pushing the Islamic State out of Manbij, a city in northern Syria they recently liberated, and are now being asked to leave because Turkey does not want them there. Lacking United States support, the Democratic Union Party has been shut out of Syrian peace talks that have been held in Geneva, and now there are increasing worries that Washington will eventually distance itself from the Syrian Kurds in a bid to improve relations with Turkey. “The U. S. themselves, they say, these are the best fighters against Daesh,” said Mr. Othman, referring to the People’s Protection Units. “These are the best allies. Hopefully they will stick to that, and help them, and not leave them in the end. ” The recent events stand in marked contrast to a year ago, when it seemed that the Kurds were capitalizing on the turmoil in the Middle East to make historic gains. In Syria, they had secured land and found a powerful benefactor in the United States. In Turkey, for the first time, a Kurdish political party entered Parliament after elections. In Iraq, amid the fight against the Islamic State, they took control of Kirkuk, a city historically divided between Arabs and Kurds. A year later, though, those prospects have dimmed. Iraq’s Kurds, somewhat insulated from the Syrian crisis, are pushing forward with their ambitions for independence, undaunted by an economic crisis. But in Turkey a   war has resumed between the Kurdistan Workers’ Party and the Turkish state, and the main Kurdish political party has been isolated from national politics. In Syria, the Turkish military has quashed the Kurds’ efforts to link their two territories. Further complicating matters, the Syrian conflict has become intertwined with Turkey’s domestic turmoil. Turkey now sees itself as fighting the Kurdistan Workers’ Party on three fronts: in Turkey, in northern Syria and in northern Iraq, where its members hide out in the mountains. As a result, analysts now say that there can be no final settlement of the Syrian civil war without the resumption of peace talks between Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, of which the Democratic Union Party is its Syrian affiliate. For now, the Kurds are still counting on the Americans to preserve them a place in a future Syrian state. “They should help them politically, to have rights in Syria,” Mr. Othman said. The Kurds, he said, “want a new Syria to be established, with them having a say in it. ” If nothing else, the American military support, even without any promises on the political front, has legitimized the Syrian Kurds’ ambitions. It has helped them to secure a large section of territory they say they will never give up, no matter what their patrons do. “Throughout history, the Kurds were abandoned,” said Ahmad Haj Mansour, a Democratic Union Party official who lives in Britain. “But now, the time and place is different. We don’t need world powers to survive. We are in charge of our land, and we have fighters. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"QUETTA, Pakistan/JAKARTA (Reuters) - Christmas church services and other celebrations are being held this weekend under the gaze of armed guards and security cameras in many countries after Islamic State gunmen attacked a Methodist church in Pakistan as a Sunday service began. Majority-Muslim countries in Asia and the Middle East were particularly nervous after U.S. President Donald Trump s recent announcement he intends to relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a decision that has outraged many Muslims. In Indonesia, the world s biggest Muslim-majority country, police said they had stepped up security around churches and tourist sites, mindful of near-simultaneous attacks on churches there at Christmas in 2000 that killed about 20 people. Muslim volunteers in Indonesia are also on standby to provide additional security if requested.  If our brother and sisters who celebrate Christmas need ... to maintain their security to worship, we will help,  said Yaqut Chiolil Qoumas, chairman of the youth wing of the Nahdlatul Ulema, one of the country s biggest Muslim organizations. In Cairo, where a bombing at the Egyptian capital s largest Coptic cathedral killed at least 25 people last December, the interior ministry said police would conduct regular searches of streets around churches ahead of the Coptic celebration of Christmas on Jan. 7. Egypt s Christian minority has been targeted in several attacks in recent years, including the bombing of two churches in the north of the country on Palm Sunday in April. At the Heliopolis Basilica, a Catholic cathedral in northeastern Cairo, security forces had set up metal detectors at the main doors and police vehicles were stationed outside ahead of masses on Dec. 25, which marks Christmas Day for Catholic and Protestant Christians. German police brought in experts and an explosives robot to investigate a suspicious package at a Christmas market in the city of Bonn late on Friday.  Germany is on high alert a year after a failed Tunisian asylum seeker killed 12 people when he hijacked a truck and drove it into a Berlin Christmas market. BOMBED-OUT CHURCH In the Pakistani city of Quetta, members of a Bethel Memorial Methodist Church were repairing the damage done by a pair of suicide bombers who attacked during a service last Sunday, killing 10 people and wounding more than 50. Broken pews and damaged musical instruments were still strewn around church grounds on Thursday, with about a dozen police standing guard.  We re making efforts to complete repairs and renovation before Christmas, but it seems difficult in view of the lot of damage,  said Pastor Simon Bashir, who was leading the service when the attackers struck. He was not hurt. The government of Baluchistan province, of which Quetta is  capital, plans to deploy 3,000 security personnel in and around 39 Christian churches this Sunday and Monday. Provincial police chief Moazzam Jah Ansari told Reuters volunteers from churches were also being trained to conduct body searches and identify worshippers entering churches. Pakistan s Christian minority, which makes up about 1 percent of the population of 208 million, has been a frequent target, along with Shi ite and Sufi Muslims, of Sunni Muslim militants. In the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, where an Easter Day bombing in a park last year killed more than 70 people, police Detective Inspector General Haider Ashraf said every church would be monitored with CCTV cameras as part of security measures. Christian Kaleem Masih lost his aunt in the Easter attack, which was claimed by Islamic State, and his wife was wounded, but he said they would be attending Christmas services.  Christmas is our holy day,  Kaleem said.  We will fulfill our religious duty by celebrating it with smiles on our faces.  In Malaysia, a police official said Trump s decision on Jerusalem increased worry about attacks.  We are concerned not only with safety at churches and places of worship but also any threats by Islamic State or any other security threat following the Jerusalem issue,  said Malaysia s Inspector-General of Police Mohamad Fuzi Harun. Jerusalem, revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, is home to Islam s third holiest site and has been at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it in an action not recognized internationally. Protests across the Muslim world in Asia and the Middle East have largely been peaceful. In Jerusalem itself, an Israeli police spokesman said there were no new security measures but police would deploy forces as usual around Christian holy sites including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and also secure convoys of worshippers from the West Bank city of Bethlehem, traditionally known as the birthplace of Jesus Christ and run by the Palestinian Authority. Many Palestinian Christians oppose Trump s announcement and say they have no fear of attacks.  Trump s decision offended all Palestinians, be they Christians or Muslims. Why would we feel threatened by Muslims?  said George Antone, a Catholic who lives in Gaza, which is run by the Palestinian Hamas group. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"While Republicans whine that President Obama isn t going after ISIS hard enough, a CNN host reminded them that only Congress can declare war.It s right there in Article I of the Constitution. Only Congress has the power to declare war. The president does not have that power. In order for President Obama to take on ISIS with the full resources and military strength of the Unites States, Congress must declare war.But so far, Republicans have been cowards and refused to do so, instead claiming that President Obama already has the power to go full throttle against what they claim is our most dangerous enemy today.If ISIS is such a big threat, then why not declare war?That was CNN host Chris Cuomo s question when he grilled GOP Rep. Sean Duffy on Thursday.Duffy claimed that President Obama has not done enough to defeat and destroy ISIS, including saying the magic words  radical Islamic terrorism,  and said that Republicans should hold a sit-in protest at the White House demanding he take more action. Our generals say we could take out ISIS in weeks if not months,  Duffy declared. However, that s because there would have to be ground troops involved, which means war.Duffy claimed that President Obama is responsible for the Orlando mass shooting because he hasn t pursued ISIS enough even though airstrikes have killed thousands of ISIS fighters since the terrorist organization began their rampage across the Middle East.Cuomo replied by pointing out that Republicans in Congress have the power to help President Obama prosecute the fight against ISIS but don t want to be held responsible for sending troops into battle. I don t know what you re asking for that isn t done right now,  Cuomo said.  The generals do say they can take out ISIS, but we know what they re asking for: They re asking for boots on the ground. You re part of a Congress that won t even have a vote on the authorization for use of military force against ISIS. Duffy claimed that President Obama has the  all the authority he needs  because of the power Congress gave President Bush over ten years ago. The problem, however, is that those authorizations were to fight al-Qaeda in response to the 9/11 attacks and Congress has changed significantly since then. Most of the members serving now were not around at that time. If it matters so much, why not take control of it with the power that s yours?  Cuomo asked. Duffy claimed that he would  gladly  do it.Cuomo slammed Duffy by noting that Republicans never give President Obama blanket power. All they do is obstruct him from doing anything, yet they have no problem with him overstepping his constitutional authority to wage war against an enemy Congress has not declared war on.Duffy then changed the subject back to guns and why we shouldn t do anything to prevent terrorists from legally buying guns to commit mass shootings.Here s the video via YouTube.To be blunt, Republicans have been looking for any reason to impeach President Obama ever since he first took office. So far, they haven t found any legitimate reason or they would have done it already. And that s why it s important to question why Republicans won t declare war and why they are demanding that President Obama do more against ISIS.If President Obama listened to Republicans and began waging war against ISIS complete with the use of thousands of ground troops, they would crucify him for overstepping the authority of Congress and violating the Constitution and the separation of powers. They would then be able to legitimately claim that President Obama abused his power and could then impeach him.That is the only logical reason why Republicans are so insistent that President Obama unilaterally go to war against ISIS. But President Obama is smarter than they are and has refused to take the bait.If Republicans really want America to do more in the fight against ISIS the answer is simple. They should use their constitutional authority to declare war instead of being cowards.Featured image via screen capture",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"The Atlantic, a publication that wouldn t know unbiased journalism if it bit them in the a$$ published what appears to be a reluctant piece on President Trump s outstanding accomplishments during his first 6 months in office. Most of the people reading this piece by The Atlantic are fans of their writing because they ve bought into the progressive, anti-American sentiment they were fed like crack cocaine in college. Almost like the patch that smokers wear to help them get through the withdrawal of nicotine while going through a cessation program, The Atlantic provides their readers with enough anti-Trump propaganda to keep them in business, while acting like a support group for their readers, who fear every anti-American piece of legislation Barack Obama worked so hard to implement, is all unraveling, thanks to this guy who  foolishly  wants  Make America Great Again . Of course, in the eyes of The Atlantic reader, America was never great to begin with.The parts where The Atlantic talks about President Trump s accomplishments are italicized and the comments the writer makes to counter Trump s successes have been highlighted.The Atlantic starts out the article by giving credit to Trump s  shadow government , as somehow being responsible for his amazing successes in his first 6 months. According to The Atlantic, the  actual government  is the fake news stories and the obsession with negative chatter surrounding Trump s presidency, while President Trump s accomplishments have been hidden in the  shadows .The Atlantic  Imagine, if you will, that there is a shadow government.The actual government, the administration of Donald Trump, is coming off the worst week of his presidency, although there haven t been any smooth weeks. Trump s top legislative priority, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, seems dead for the moment. (Tax reform? Forget it.) His administration has set a new standard for chaos and dysfunction, rolling through staffers the way other administrations run through, well, legislative initiatives. Trump s foreign policy remains inchoate and ineffective. Meanwhile, a special counsel investigation looms over the entire administration, threatening both its legitimacy and legal jeopardy for some of its members.Things are going considerably better for the shadow government. With the Trump administration s chaos sucking up all the attention, it s been able to move forward on a range of its priorities, which tend to be more focused on regulatory matters anyway. It is remaking the justice system, rewriting environmental rules, overhauling public-lands administration, and greenlighting major infrastructure projects. It is appointing figures who will guarantee the triumph of its ideological vision for decades to come. let s consider the Trump administration s accomplishments. Spoiler alert: like climate change, they re real.One of the two biggest victories has come on border security, which was one of Trump s top campaign priorities. Border crossings have already plummeted, suggesting that rhetoric making it clear to immigrants that they are not welcome is effective in its own right. Customs and Border Protections report that apprehensions of unauthorized people are down nearly 20 percent from the same time in 2016. (Trump continues to radically exaggerate these figures, though.) This decline has occurred despite Trump being foiled on his actual policy proposals at the border. Construction hasn t begun on his border wall yet, and federal courts have repeatedly smacked down his Muslim travel ban.That said, he did get one good result in courts and that points to a second area of success. The Supreme Court allowed parts of the travel ban to go forward, in a victory that would not have happened without Neil Gorsuch on the court, filling a seat that under all previous customs would have been filled by Barack Obama s appointee Merrick Garland. Given his legislative struggles, the most enduring Trump victories are likely to come in the judicial branch.Trump may get to appoint several more justices to the high court. And in the meantime, he s filling up lower courts with lifetime appointees. As the veteran Democratic official Ron Klain wrote recently,  A massive transformation is underway in how our fundamental rights are defined by the federal judiciary. For while President Trump is incompetent at countless aspects of his job, he is proving wildly successful in one respect: naming youthful conservative nominees to the federal bench in record-setting numbers. There are the quiet, far-reaching changes. Getting back to Pruitt, the environment is one of the places where the Trump administration has had its largest impact. The most prominent move was Trump s June 1 announcement that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. But the EPA is moving on other fronts as well. It s working to dismantle Barack Obama s Clean Power Plan, a signature policy aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. In June, following a February executive order from Trump, the EPA began the process of rescinding the 2015 Waters of the United States rule, which aimed at protecting smaller bodies of water and streams in the same way that larger ones had been. In December, in the closing weeks of his administration, Obama banned drilling in the Arctic and parts of the Atlantic Ocean; the Trump administration promptly set about undoing that ban. (How interested oil companies will be remains to be seen.)The New York Times found in June that Pruitt s EPA  has moved to undo, delay or otherwise block more than 30 environmental rules, a regulatory rollback larger in scope than any other over so short a time in the agency s 47-year history.  And it might have done more if not for constraints imposed by judges. EPA tried to abandon an Obama-era rule on methane emissions, but a court on Monday forced it to continue enforcing the rule.Other agencies are also in on the environmental deregulation act. The State Department reversed an Obama-era decision, clearing the way for the Keystone XL pipeline to begin construction. The Interior Department is considering reversing a rule on fracking on public lands, and might also reverse some equipment regulations on offshore drilling equipment implemented after the 2010 Gulf oil spill. The department has rolled back a ban on coal mining on public lands.Although the Justice Department had staunchly opposed a Texas voting law that has repeatedly been smacked down by courts as discriminatory, Sessions switched the department s position, and it has now told courts the law ought to be allowed to remain. The attorney general has also sought to cut off funding to so-called sanctuary cities, though his legal authority to do so is disputed.Curiously, since he campaigned as an atypically LGBT-friendly Republican, Trump has also made a range of changes on gay issues. Last week alone, the Justice Department announced that sexual orientation was not covered by Section VII, and the president said that transgender people would not be allowed to serve in the military. The administration has also rejected Obama-era protections for transgender students. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"(Reuters) - A veteran federal prosecutor recruited onto special counsel Robert Mueller’s team is known for a skill that may come in handy in the investigation of potential ties between Russia and U.S. President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign team: persuading witnesses to turn on friends, colleagues and superiors. Andrew Weissmann, who headed the U.S. Justice Department’s criminal fraud section before joining Mueller’s team last month, is best known for two assignments - the investigation of now-defunct energy company Enron and organized crime cases in Brooklyn, New York - that depended heavily on gaining witness cooperation. Securing the cooperation of people close to Trump, many of whom have been retaining their own lawyers, could be important for Mueller, who was named by the Justice Department as special counsel on May 17 and is investigating, among other issues, whether Trump himself has sought to obstruct justice. Trump has denied allegations of both collusion and obstruction.  “Flipping” witnesses is a common, although not always successful, tactic in criminal prosecutions. Robert Ray, who succeeded Kenneth Starr as the independent counsel examining former President Bill Clinton, noted that Trump’s fired former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, has already offered through his lawyer to testify before Congress in exchange for immunity, suggesting potential willingness to cooperate as a witness. “It would seem to me the time is now to make some decisions about what you have and what leverage can be applied to get the things you don’t have,” Ray said, referring to Mueller’s team. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and others close to the president already have hired their own lawyers to help navigate Mueller’s expanding probe and ongoing congressional investigations. Kathryn Ruemmler, who served as White House counsel under former President Barack Obama, said Weissmann is willing to take risks to secure witness testimony that other prosecutors might not. Ruemmler worked with Weissmann on the Justice Department’s Enron task force that investigated the massive corporate fraud that led to the company’s 2001 collapse.  Ruemmler recalled that Weissmann had a hunch that former Enron treasurer Ben Glisan would be willing to talk despite already having pleaded guilty without agreeing to cooperate. So Weissmann had U.S. marshals bring Glisan before the grand jury from prison, Ruemmler said.  Other prosecutors might have feared Glisan’s testimony could contradict their theory of the case, Ruemmler said, but Weissmann’s gamble paid off when the former executive became a key witness. “He’s not afraid to lose, and that is sometimes an unusual quality,” Ruemmler said of Weissmann. Weissmann also led lengthy negotiations with lawyers for Andrew Fastow, Enron’s former chief financial officer and a star prosecution witness in the case, gaining leverage from the fact that prosecutors had indicted Fastow’s wife, also a former Enron employee, on tax fraud charges. Both pleaded guilty, and Fastow testified against former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who was convicted in 2006. Fastow declined to comment. Glisan could not be reached for comment. Representatives for Mueller and the Trump legal team declined to comment. Critics have said say Weissmann’s hardball approach can lead to prosecutorial overreach. A number of Enron convictions were overturned on appeal, and Skilling’s 24-year sentence was later reduced by 10 years. Defense lawyer Tom Kirkendall, who represented clients related to the Enron case, said the task force intimidated witnesses and misinterpreted the law. But Sam Buell, a former prosecutor who was a member of the Enron task force, called such criticism routine in high-stakes cases. Mueller has several other highly experienced lawyers on his team, including U.S. Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben. Trump has also been building a legal team led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz, with veteran Washington defense lawyer John Dowd recently coming aboard. Before his work relating to Enron, Weissmann served as a federal prosecutor in the organized crime bureau in Brooklyn. In 1997, he and trial partner George Stamboulidis brought down one of the country’s most powerful mob bosses, Vincent “the Chin” Gigante, with the help of turncoat witnesses. “We cut our teeth in the organized crime section,” said Stamboulidis, now in private practice. “And the only way you can make those cases is to get people to cooperate, even when the oath of Omerta (a Mafia code of silence and non-cooperation with authorities) was strong and in full play.” ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Katrina Pierson is a black woman. She is also a top spokesperson for unabashed racist Donald Trump. She apparently buys into Trump s horrible ideas and rhetoric, though, as she defends him at every turn. Hell, she might be just as crazy as he is, as she even went so far as to appear on national television wearing a necklace made out of bullets in order to tout Trump s staunch support for the second amendment.However, it is about time someone took this black woman to task for her blind support of a clear racist, and, finally, CNN pundit and GOP strategist Tara Setmeyer did so. The pundit absolutely blasted Pierson, and said that she is simply  one of the blacks he likes since he pays her to clean up his mess everyday on television. When Setmeyer pointed out how Trump is under fire for refusing to firmly toss aside an endorsement from former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke, Pierson dodged the question, saying: Mr. Trump said, look, I don t even know what you re talking about. So, I think this has really been blown out of proportion. And it really does highlight more media bias when no one has asked Barack Obama to disavow Sen. Robert Byrd, who was not just a klans [sic] member, but a leader in the Klan when he endorsed him in 2008. The thing is, though, Pierson, like so many ignorant Trump supporters, failed to notice the fact that Byrd had a BIG change of heart a hell of a long time ago, according to a book he wrote. So, completely different kettle of tripe entirely, as Duke is still very much an avowed racist.Setmeyer pushed Pierson, and plowed on: He brags about how he can manipulate folks. We sit and we watched this play out over the weekend, where Donald Trump took five different positions because he got pressured into having to actually admit to what was going on. David Duke absolutely came out and said it s against your heritage if you don t vote for Donald Trump, okay. That s an endorsement. Give me a break. And then to say, I couldn t hear what was going on, they gave me a [bad] earpiece. Anyone who watched the interview with Jake Tapper, Donald Trump clearly heard everything that Jake Tapper said. He responded to it. He didn t say,  Oh, I can t hear you, this isn t a good earpiece. Clearly getting angry, Pierson yelled at the hosts: The Democrats have called the Tea Party racists! Should we have him disavow the Tea Party too? Absolutely not! But Setmeyer, in the end got the best of Pierson, and called her out for what she is: We aren t even talking about Donald Trump s questionable history with race back to when the DOJ sued the Trump organization for racial discrimination. Or when Donald Trump came out and said how much he loves   quote    the blacks  or we can go down the list of very questionable things Donald Trump has said. But I don t know. Maybe Katrina Pierson is one of the blacks he likes since he pays her to clean up his mess everyday on television. And that s just it. Trump is fine with black folks, just since they bow, turn their backs on their own race, and go  YASSA MASSA!  when he comes running. They help assure the ignorant and blind people that he is somehow  not racist  no matter what he says.Of course, in the end, Pierson lamely went back to what Trump and all of his supporters say: He s winning. That s all that matters. He s winning. The sad thing is, though, is that Katrina Pierson, and so many other Trump supporters, seem to actually believe that.Watch the video below via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Both U.S. presidential candidates plan to watch Tuesday night’s election returns in New York, prompting the city to stage the largest Election Day police deployment in its history, officials said on Monday. More than 5,000 police officers will be stationed around the United States’ largest city, and there will be extensive street closures in the neighborhoods where Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump plan to watch returns come in - and where one will likely declare victory before hundreds of cheering supporters. “We know that the eyes of the world will be on New York City,” Mayor Bill de Blasio told a news conference on Monday. “We have an obligation, not only to the people in the city but to this country, to make sure that tomorrow, all through the day and particularly tomorrow night, go smoothly and goes well.” Clinton plans to hold her election night event at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center near the Hudson River, while Trump’s will be at a large Hilton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan.     The city’s heightened security efforts come after federal authorities received unspecific threats of attacks by the al Qaeda militant group on New York City, Texas and Virginia around Election Day.  Tuesday will be the first time that both major party candidates have spent Election Day in New York City since 1944, when New York state’s Republican governor, Thomas Dewey, tried to unseat Democrat and New Yorker Franklin Roosevelt, who went on to win an unprecedented fourth term in office. The New York City Police Department plans to station uniformed officers, including some with automatic weapons and explosives-detection equipment, across Manhattan and the city’s 1,205 polling stations. All of the city’s bomb-sniffing police dogs will be deployed, as well as special roving teams of officers, police said. The candidates will also be protected by the U.S. Secret Service, which has provided security for both candidates during the presidential campaign and will work with the city police department on Tuesday. “This is by far the largest election detail that the NYPD has ever had,” said Carlos Gomez, the chief of department. “It’s comparable to the detail size we have here on New Year’s Eve and last year when Pope Francis visited.” Trump has longstanding ties to New York City, where he was born and followed in his father’s footsteps as a real estate developer.  Clinton moved to the suburb of Chappaqua, New York, following President Bill Clinton’s eight years in the White House, and served as a U.S. senator from the state from 2001 through 2008.

0,WELFake Dataset,"by Jon Rappoport, Activist Post : 
“If Donald Trump can help her [Hillary] heal, then perhaps that’s a good thing to do.” —Kellyanne Conway, former Trump campaign manager 
Donald Trump achieved two great things in his presidential campaign: he stopped Hillary Clinton from occupying the White House, and he ran against the media by attacking them mercilessly. 
Everything else is up for grabs. We will see. 
Already, he has made some “errors.” The appointment of Mike Pompeo as CIA director is a bad move. Pompeo, as a congressman, introduced the Dark Act, which now prevents the states from requiring GMO labels on food. And he favors the death sentence for Edward Snowden. 
Multiple media outlets are reporting that Trump will not attempt to prosecute Hillary Clinton. This is on the level of lowering the window shades for a vampire as dawn breaks. Hillary was certainly guilty in the email case, and the Clinton Foundation is a pay-for-play money laundering operation of global proportions—a private and parallel State Department, in which cash is the only standard for “diplomacy.” And these charges are mere low-hanging fruit on the Clinton crime family tree. 
Pursuing justice is supposed to be a Trump hallmark. 
Politics in the Matrix is a tap dance and a shuffle. Deals and compromises are made all the way along the line. Washington and its media allies suck their very life juices from those deals. Like some fungus, they thrive in the dark every-day corruption of This traded for That. In many ways, Trump exclaimed he was above the game. The deals he was going to make would all be on the side of benefiting America—so he has a price to pay for asserting he was most definitely a different character on the political scene. 
That unbridled assertion was what drove huge numbers of people to show up at his rallies all over the country. They wanted an outsider who had a serious ax to grind with Washington and the media. They wanted him to be angry and outraged—because they were, too. They didn’t want a great healer, because justice comes before healing. 
Many of them had felt the effects of Globalism and its grotesque trade treaties. They were out of work, and he was going to bring back jobs. But that wasn’t their only motivation. They knew their jobs had been stolen by anti-American elites, and they wanted the sword of justice to fall on those elites. They knew Hillary Clinton was an arch-Globalist. 
For these millions of Trump supporters, forgiving and forgetting and moving on isn’t presidential. It smells bad. They were never part of the glazed-over New Age crowd, and they aren’t now. The cheese-glob “coming together” isn’t in their lexicon. They don’t view anger as a character defect or a “compensatory” response that traces back into early childhood. They want bad people to pay for their crimes. 
Hillary Clinton would be at the top of their list. Helping her heal is a sick joke. They want her in prison where she belongs. They know her constant vapid calls for “national unity” during the campaign were a straight-out con, a cover for her lust for power. 
They see nothing redeeming about her. It’s simple: she fights the good and embraces evil. Therefore, she should be punished. 
Doing so would set an example and a course for the Trump administration: we don’t back away, we don’t back down. We aren’t separating “campaign talk” from presidential action. We’re not trying to make that phony distinction. 
If Trump prosecuted Hillary to the full extent of the law, then of course the owls would come out hooting: he’s vengeful; he can’t let go; he’s mean; he’s spiteful; he’s a cruel sadist; this goes beyond any civilized sense of propriety befitting a real leader. 
Yes? And? So? 
So what? 
Is Trump the same man now that he was when he was campaigning? 
Even asking that question seems naïve, because of course we know all politicians rearrange themselves after they win a victory. But Trump portrayed himself as very, very different. He stood on that difference. He celebrated it. He reveled in it. He took great pleasure in it. 
Now, he has to pay the price. 
His supporters don’t want to hear some garbled nonsense about how prosecuting Hillary would create a giant distraction from the job of leading the country. Trump’s whole campaign was a distraction from politics as usual. That’s what gave him strength. 
Prosecuting Hillary Clinton now would be counter-intuitive and outrageous, and therefore it would be the most Trumpian thing Trump could do. 
It would give him more support from his millions of people. 
And it would be right and correct and it would deliver justice where justice has been needed for a very long time. 
And when the whole host of sordid details about Hillary’s crimes came spilling out into the light, people who pride themselves on being in the camp of the “beautiful and virtuous” would realize who they have been defending. 
It would provide a valuable lesson, and the price of admittance to that show would trump the decades of waiting America has endured in the case of The People vs. Hillary Clinton. 
This case has now been canceled.

Broward County is one of the largest swing counties in Florida. It would not take much voter fraud there to flip it. 
The voter fraud whistle-blower is a former Secretary of Elections Department employee and she has filled out a sworn affidavit: 
You can read the affidavit here. The affidavit by Chelsey Marie Smith accuses Broward County officials of filling out blank absentee ballots to officials who she saw filling the ballots out at the Supervisor of Elections headquarters. Smith said she was asked to deliver numerous ballots to a secret locked room where employees were filling out the absentee ballots. At first she was not clear as to what was happening. When she finally clearly saw what was up and reported it, she was terminated and told to never come back! 
After being caught red-handed engaging in voter fraud, Broward Country FL Sec of Elections Brenda Snipes claimed staff were “replicating damaged ballots” in the locked secret room without official monitors present. Yeah, that was a good one Brenda! 
According to the whistle-blower, the massive voter fraud went on day after day and included what had to be thousands of ballots. Brenda Snipes is already under lawsuit for deliberately misprinting absentee ballots! Why is she still around? 
Donald Trump is currently preparing a lawsuit against Snipes and the FL State Attorney investigators are actively reviewing the voter fraud case. Secretary of Election employees in Broward County, FL caught filling out absentee ballots! #FloridaFraud pic.twitter.com/MqjmFtDXHX 
— Mike Cernovich 🇺🇸 (@Cernovich) November 4, 2016 
Recently, numerous Florida voters have complained that they have not been receiving their absentee ballots. It seems we have found where some are going! How many other counties have a secret locked room!! 
Democrats live by an “ends justify the means” mentality. Cheating and stealing is of no issue to them as long as the outcome is the one that they want! Voter Fraud is entirely legitimate to them. 
UPDATE: 
Fox News reported that the Florida GOP has also filed a voter fraud lawsuit for illegally opening absentee ballots! 
The state GOP alleges that officials in Broward County, which includes Fort Lauderdale, have been opening tens of thousands of vote-by-mail ballots prior to them being cleared for counting. 
Chairman Blaise Ingoglia told Shapiro that “Florida law prescribes that when the supervisor of elections takes in all these ballots, they have to be approved by the canvassing board.” 
Therefore, the officials have no legal authority to open the ballot envelopes. 
Ingoglia said none of the ballots had been approved, so the party will be filing a lawsuit at 9 a.m. ET Thursday if county officials do not respond to his complaint by close-of-business on Wednesday.

They are the enemy of the people,  he said, criticizing their  dishonest coverage  of his administration.Trump admitted that the media was very upset by his repeated criticisms, but that he would continue to do so, citing the First Amendment.

Supporters lined up hours early to get in the conference hall, but had to go through tight security to enter the building.During his speech, the president vowed to keep his campaign promises, specifically a repeal and replace of Obamacare, building the Keystone and Dakota pipelines, building a wall on the southern border, restoring military funding.

0,WELFake Dataset,"LONDON (Reuters) - Brexit minister David Davis called on parliament on Thursday to back legislation to sever Britain s political, financial and legal ties with the European Union, saying that opposing the bill would lead to chaos. At a rowdy session of parliament, Davis accused the opposition Labour Party of pursuing a  cynical and unprincipled  path by challenging the repeal bill, or EU withdrawal bill, designed to disentangle Britain from more than 40 years of EU lawmaking. Labour, in turn, said the government was using the bill to give itself wide-ranging powers and a  blank cheque  to do away with laws if ministers did not like them, threatening the rights of ordinary Britons. The legislation is a vital stepping-stone towards Britain s departure from the EU in March 2019. It faces stormy debate and a likely barrage of attempted amendments as Prime Minister Theresa May, weakened by the loss of her majority in a June election and criticized by Brussels over her Brexit strategy, attempts to steer it through parliament.  Without this legislation a smooth and orderly exit is impossible ... To delay or oppose the bill will be reckless in the extreme,  Davis told lawmakers, describing support for a proposed amendment by Labour as a  vote for a chaotic exit . Labour s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, said several clauses in the bill amounted to a  power grab  by government. He said it would prevent Britain from remaining in the EU s single market and customs union during a transition phase, as Labour now argues should happen.  That we are leaving (the EU) is settled, how we leave is not. This bill invites us to surrender all power and influence over that question to the government and to ministers. That would betray everything we have been sent here to do,  Starmer said.  Unless the government makes a very significant concession before we vote on Monday Labour will table, and has tabled, a reasoned amendment and will vote against the bill.      The legislation seeks largely to  copy and paste  EU law into British legislation to ensure the UK has functioning laws and the same regulatory framework as the bloc at the moment of leaving it, something that may offer some reassurance for companies. Davis said it would allow the British government and parliament to become  masters of our own laws , and promised concerned lawmakers that ministers would not use the wide-ranging powers to make  substantive changes  to law. To vote down the bill, Labour would need to convince EU supporters in May s Conservatives to side with them, but some more vocal pro-EU Conservative lawmakers have now said they will vote with the government after asking for reassurance that parliament will be able to scrutinize any changes to the law. May has also promised to listen to the concerns of lawmakers, but warned that delaying or hindering the bill with amendments would slow  vital  legislation.  The repeal bill helps deliver the outcome the British people voted for by ending the role of the EU in UK law, but it s also the single most important step we can take to prevent a cliff-edge for people and businesses, because it provides legal certainty,  she said in a statement.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is ramping up his search for a new chief for the U.S. central bank, meeting with former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh and three others and promising a decision next month. “I’ve had four meetings for Fed chairman and I’ll be making a decision over the next two or three weeks,” Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn. Trump has previously suggested he may reappoint Fed Chair Janet Yellen to the post. Jerome Powell, one of the current governors on the Fed’s board, also met with Trump earlier this week about the Fed job, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. Trump on Friday did not provide details on his meetings.  A new Fed chair would take the helm as the central bank eases well away from crisis-era policies in response to a strengthening economy and falling unemployment, though inflation still lingers below the Fed’s 2-percent goal. Under Yellen, the Fed has raised interest rates and launched a plan to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Much of the latter was accumulated through a controversial bond-buying program that Yellen said helped the economy avert an even deeper downturn. Her term as chair expires in February.  Warsh was a Fed governor between 2006 and 2011 and resigned from the board because of his opposition to the bond-buying program. He has called for a revamp of how the Fed makes monetary policy, saying it needs “fresh air” from markets and from the “real economy.”  Treasury yields spurted higher on news of the Trump meetings; Warsh is viewed as more of a hawk than Yellen. “He’s definitely more hawkish on the spectrum. He is quite a contrast to Yellen. It does seem he is the front-runner even though it’s not a sure thing he will be nominated,” Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York, said of Warsh. As recently as July, Trump had not ruled out reappointing Yellen, telling the Wall Street Journal that he liked her demeanor and desire to keep interest rates low. In addition to Warsh and Powell, Stanford University economist John Taylor’s name also has been floated as a contender. Powell specialized in financial regulatory matters during his five years on the Fed Board of Governors, which is led by the Fed chair. There has also been speculation that Trump could turn to his top economic aide, Gary Cohn, for the Fed chair position. A Fed spokesman declined to comment on the process while Warsh and Taylor did not respond to requests for comment.  ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Facebook has criticized new German hate speech law that would see social media companies pay up to €50 million in fines if they fail to remove “hate speech” on their platform. [Business Insider reports that Facebook is unhappy with Germany’s new hate speech law that would force social media companies to face heavy fines for failure to remove hate speech and fake news from their platforms. Facebook has argued that these strict new measures will result in legal and legitimate content being deleted from their platform in order to avoid the fines.  The German government proposed legislation in March that would have social media companies fined if they didn’t quickly remove posts regarded as slanderous or threatening. Germany’s cabinet approved these plans in April, but they have yet to be implemented. The new law has now been challenged by Facebook. Facebook published a statement over the weekend which outlined why the new law “is not suitable to combat hate speech and false news. ” “The draft law provides an incentive to delete content that is not clearly illegal when social networks face such a disproportionate threat of fines,” Facebook claimed. “It would have the effect of transferring responsibility for complex legal decisions from public authorities to private companies. And several legal experts have assessed the draft law as being against the German constitution and   with EU law. Facebook is committed to working in partnership with governments and civil society on solutions that will make this draft law unnecessary. ” German Justice Minister Heiko Maas disagreed, stating, “This (draft law) sets out binding standards for the way operators of social networks deal with complaints and obliges them to delete criminal content. ” He added, “there should be just as little tolerance for criminal rabble rousing on social networks as on the street. ” If Facebook refuses to comply with the law, the individual deemed responsible for the company in German could receive a personal €5 million fine, while Facebook as an organization could receive a fine of up to €50 million.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"House Republicans just made it clear that they are for sale and intend to put ethics aside during Donald Trump s reign in the White House.On Monday night, Republicans voted 119-74 to cripple the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, which has been an outside watchdog working to root out corruption by members of Congress ever since a string of lobbying scandals rocked Capitol Hill. Under Speaker Nancy Pelosi s leadership, the panel was created as a non-partisan entity and has done a good job.But Republicans are gutting it because the panel has done its job too well so they passed an amendment which basically gives them direct oversight of the panel and the power to kill investigations they don t like. So if the panel is investigating a Republicans, they can kill it and then turn around and allow an investigation against a Democrat.According to CNN,The proposal would bar the panel from reviewing any violation of criminal law by members of Congress, requiring that it turn over any complaint to the House Ethics Committee or refer the matter to an appropriate federal law enforcement agency. The House Ethics Committee would also have the power to stop an investigation at any point and bars the ethics office from making any public statements about any matters or hiring any communications staff.And the ethics office would no longer be able to accept or investigate any anonymous reports of alleged wrongdoing by members of Congress.Republicans claim that the ethics panel abused its power and that it  falsely accused  members of Congress of committing ethics violations. These members allegedly had to  spend a fortune  to defend themselves. Frankly, it sounds like Republicans are just mad because they got caught putting their hand in the cookie jar and they are attacking the panel to make sure they can t be caught again.By gutting the independent panel and placing it under their supervision, Republicans just paved the way for their members to commit crimes at will. They could a take a bribe from a lobbyist and then vote to kill any investigation that arises. It will create a free-for-all for lobbyists at a time when Republicans intend to consider infrastructure spending, tax cuts, and massive defense spending.This especially concerns Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, who served as ethics attorneys under President Obama and President Bush, because the 115th Congress  is setting itself up to be dogged by scandals and ethics issues for years and is returning the House to dark days when ethics violations were rampant and far too often tolerated. So not only will the White House be corrupt under Donald Trump, Republicans just guaranteed that the House of Representatives is going to be corrupt as well, proving once again that Republicans only care about using government to enrich themselves instead of helping the American people.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: Dakota Access Pipeline , protestors , police violence (NaturalNews) Tensions are ratcheting up in a region of North Dakota where construction of a pipeline that will take oil to a refinery facility in Illinois is being built, as protestors objecting to the project are clashing with increasingly militarized police . The Bismark Tribune reported that police and protestors clashed as authorities moved in to break up a camp on private property belonging to the pipeline developers.Protestors had initially formed a line of no surrender, the paper said, but it became a line of retreat in the face of a militarized police presence that overwhelmed hundreds of Dakota Access Pipeline protestors, pushing them back from the front line of resistance to their main camp.For about five hours on Thursday, beginning around noon, police officers pressed the protesters back about a half-mile on N.D. Highway 1806, which was away from a new camp they had built earlier in the week that sat directly atop the pipeline easement. Rubber bullets, bean bags, smoke grenades and tasers Unrest continued into the evening hours, however, as police said that two fires were started on a nearby bridge, and protestors began lobbing Molotov cocktails at officers. In addition, police reported two incidents where shots were fired.The Tribune reported that one woman allegedly fired a handgun in the direction of police as she was being arrested, while an armed man who was reportedly run off the road by protesters, and was perhaps not connected to the protest, had to be treated for a gunshot wound to the hand.As police moved in, some protestors were urging calm and prayer, but others threw rocks and water bottles at approaching officers. Eventually the crowd retreated under a barrage of pepper spray, rubber and bean bag bullets, smoke grenades and tasers.By late afternoon, flames and thick plumes of smoke belched out of the cab of one of three Dakota Access Pipeline earth movers, while protestors walked back to their main camp on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' land.In all, police arrested 141 people, the local sheriffs' department said, charging suspects with engaging in a riot, maintaining a public nuisance, and conspiracy to endanger by fire and explosion.A day before the violence, as reported by AMI Newswire , opponents of the pipeline barricaded a highway and pitched their camp on private land. These actions were led by members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.The previous weekend some 127 people had been arrested.Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II issued a statement last week in which he blamed the rising militarization of police for the increased tensions.""The militarization of local law enforcement and enlistment of multiple law enforcement agencies from neighboring states is needlessly escalating violence and unlawful arrests against peaceful protesters at Standing Rock,"" Archambault said, as quoted by AMI Newswire . ""We do not condone reports of illegal actions, but believe the majority of peaceful protesters are reacting to strong-arm tactics and abuses by law enforcement."" Destruction of burial grounds, water are chief concerns Law enforcement officers countered by saying that, for the vast majority of the protest thus far, they have shown remarkable patience and restraint, and that they only moved after protestors became more aggressive.Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier ticked off a list of alleged violations by protestors, including buzzing a police helicopter with a drone and firing arrows in the direction of officers. He also said that journalists had been harassed and security personnel assaulted.""For months protesters have described us as an aggressive police force,"" Kirchmeier said in a prepared statement, AMI Newswire reported. ""We have done nothing but demonstrate patience and restraint.""Protestors are angry about the pipeline stretching across ancient burial grounds, NewsTarget reported , as well as the potential for pipeline leaks that would pollute local water sources .

When asked by reporters who he worked for, the man replied,  I m a tourist,  and bragged about being able to sneak inside the Ohio Clock Corridor in the Capitol building.

This was a monumental f up,  a senior congressional security source told Fox News.Clayton has been on a  watch list  kept by the Capitol Police, a source said, and was denied entry to the complex earlier that day when an officer recognized him at the Russell Senate Office Building.But later on, officers in a tunnel leading to the Capitol did not check his ID to see if he had a pass or badge, the source said. He used an outdated visitor s pass to enter the Capitol through a tunnel connecting the Rayburn House Office building. After clearing the security checkpoint, he made his way outside the Senate chamber, where he blended in with credentialed congressional reporters and stood just feet away from Trump.A source also said Clayton was in possession of a four-day old pass for the location of the House Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facility, which is home to the House Intelligence Committee. Fox News is told there is no evidence so far that Clayton attempted to access that facility.PROTESTER ON WATCH LIST MAKES HIS WAY INTO PRESS GROUP TO THROW RUSSIAN FLAGS AT POTUS:As we previously reported: A protester on Tuesday shouted  Treason!  at President Trump and threw mini Russian flags at him as he arrived for a meeting with Senate Republicans: The unhinged left is at it again They only make themselves look like lunatics when they pull stunts like this:A protester threw Russian flags at President Trump on Tuesday as he entered the GOP policy lunch.The protester could be heard shouting  Trump is treason  as the president walked by.Random guy threw Russian flags at Trump and shouted  Trump is treason  pic.twitter.com/stVfDOtMAB  a da ch vez (@aidachavez_) October 24, 2017 Why are you talking about tax cuts when you should be talking about treason?  the man could be heard shouting in videos.He was later identified as Americans Take Action s Ryan Clayton.Clayton is known for expressing his anti-Trump views by tossing Russia flags.

0,WELFake Dataset,"A federal judge on Thursday blocked an Indiana law that would have banned abortions based solely on a fetus’s disability or genetic anomaly, suggesting that it was an illegal limit on a woman’s   constitutional right. Judge Tanya Walton Pratt, of Federal District Court for Southern Indiana, also held up a state ban on abortions motivated solely by a fetus’s race or sex. In the preliminary injunction, Judge Pratt said limiting the reasons for an abortion was “inconsistent with the notion of a right rooted in privacy concerns and a liberty right to make independent decisions. ” While Judge Pratt’s injunction stops the law from taking immediate effect, and though she said the state would be unlikely to prevail at trial, the state can still defend the legislation. In a statement, the Indiana attorney general’s office said state lawyers would consider how to proceed and whether to appeal the injunction. Indiana would have been the first state to have a blanket ban on abortions based solely on race, sex or suspected disabilities, including evidence of Down syndrome. A handful of states have bans on abortion based on sex, one state has a ban based on race, and two have bans based on genetic anomalies, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit abortion rights group that tracks state laws. Judge Pratt’s decision, the first in a federal court to indicate that a ban on abortion because of genetic anomalies would likely be unconstitutional, is the latest setback for   groups. It comes days after a landmark Supreme Court ruling in a Texas case that two other kinds of restrictions  —   requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at local hospitals and imposing stringent   standards on abortion clinics  —   are unconstitutional. The Texas measures would have forced many clinics to shut down. In language that is expected to echo nationally, the Supreme Court held in its Monday ruling that the benefits of any such restrictions must be closely scrutinized and weighed against the burdens on women’s access to abortion. Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement that “momentum from Monday’s landmark decision” was aiding in challenges to abortion restrictions in Indiana and elsewhere. “These unconstitutional laws punish women, and we will bring them down, law by law and state by state,” Ms. Richards said. “We have been fighting these restrictions on all fronts for years, organizing in the field, building for this moment  —   and now the wind is at our backs. ” Kara Brooks, a spokeswoman for Gov. Mike Pence, said in a statement on Thursday that the governor was “disappointed” in the ruling and “remains steadfast in his support for the unborn, especially those with disabilities. ” Judge Pratt’s decision was also criticized in a statement by Indiana Right to Life, which noted that the jurist had been nominated by President Obama. That group’s chief executive, Mike Fichter, said the ruling “denied the civil rights of unborn children” and was “an appalling human rights injustice. ” Thursday’s case in Indiana was argued long before the new Supreme Court decision, and Judge Pratt’s opinion made no reference to it. Her ruling rested largely on the argument that the state, as established in a series of cases starting with Roe v. Wade in 1973, cannot impede a woman’s right to decide to have an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb, usually at around 24 weeks. Judge Pratt said “irreparable harm” would have occurred had that part of the law taken effect as scheduled on Friday. “Difficult moral and complicated health decisions are made by women whose pregnancies are affected by a prenatal fetal anomaly,” Judge Pratt wrote in her ruling. “Given the relatively short time frame in which women may elect to terminate a pregnancy, even a short disruption of a woman’s ability to do so could have significant consequences. ” Indiana’s law, signed in March by Mr. Pence, was framed by abortion foes and legislative Republicans as a way to prevent discrimination in abortions, in particular the fetuses with Down syndrome. Mr. Pence, a Republican, said that he signed the law “with a prayer that God would continue to bless these precious children, mothers and families. ” But the local chapters of Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the measure, claiming the law posed an undue burden to women and restricted freedom of speech, and asking Judge Pratt for the preliminary injunction she issued on Thursday. That injunction also sets aside a portion of the law that imposed new restrictions for disposing of fetal remains. Indiana’s law was exceptional for its breadth, but the restrictions it included were not unprecedented. Such legislation has become more common and has gained traction in many   statehouses. Dawn Johnsen, an Indiana University law professor who has pushed for abortion rights, said Thursday’s injunction was an important step toward invalidating such legislation. “It’s very strong reaffirmation of the constitutional right as the Supreme Court has interpreted it, but applied to new, creative, harmful restrictions,” Ms. Johnsen said. The Indiana measure had been controversial from the start, and Mr. Pence waited until his deadline before signing it into law. In the weeks that followed, abortion rights supporters rallied outside the Capitol against the law and started an online “Periods for Pence” campaign that encouraged women to tell the governor about their reproductive health.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Bill Maher: That ‘Lesser Of Two Evils’ Election Argument Is ‘BULLSH*T!’ (VIDEO) By Andrew Bradford on October 29, 2016 Subscribe 
Since it first became clear that this year’s nominees for their respective parties would be Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, there’s been some whining among voters that they are being forced to choose between the “lesser of two evils.” And for those people, Real Time host Bill Maher has a very simple but direct message : “Grow the fu*k up!” 
On his show last night, Maher directly confronted the “less of two evils” griping by explaining what’s at stake in this election: “Republicans have one path to this election and it’s ‘false equivalency.’ They can’t deny Trump is horrible – it’s on tape. So they want voters to believe that Hillary is just as bad. And in pursuit of that goal they have a very powerful ally — lazy people. “People who like to say, ‘they’re all bad.’ Because when you say that, you don’t have to do any homework. Say, ‘they’re all the same,’ and you can sound justifiably jaded by the entire process when, really, you just don’t know anything.” 
Finally, Maher directed his comments at millennial voters who he said are wrongly obsessed with “bullshit” trivia: “I am so tired of hearing that Hillary doesn’t seem genuine. Grow the fuck up.” 
Exactly! Hillary isn’t “genuine?” So would you rather have a man who is a genuine serial sexual assaulter of women and a threat to the national and economic security of the United States? Those of us who care about what happens in the future because we love our children need to put aside our petty picking at a woman who has devoted her life to helping others and elect her as President. If we fail to do so, future generations will never forgive us.

0,WELFake Dataset,"In a “white paper” published by the Washington Post, ATF Associate Deputy Director Ronald Turk shows that a continued ban on the importation of numerous “assault weapons” is nonsensical. [The reasons behind his assessment include the growing use of   and similar rifles for hunting and shooting sports.  Turk wrote, “Since the sunset of the Assault Weapons ban in 2004, the use of     and similar rifles now commonly referred to as ‘modern sporting rifles’  has increased exponentially in sport shooting. These firearm types are now standard for hunting activities. ” Because of his paradigm shift regarding the view and usage of “assault weapons,” Turk suggests the ATF review and update its “almost    study” on such firearms. He then made clear that another reason for lifting importation limitations is the fact that American manufacturers currently make and sell rifles that are identical or similar to many of the firearms that are banned from import. Because of this, “restriction on imports serves questionable public safety interests. ” Turk also noted that a characteristic of importation bans in this area has been modifications to   rifles modifications that allow them to survive the import restrictions and enter the U. S. under different classifications. The various classifications mean more unnecessary work for importers and more paperwork for the ATF. He also addressed suppressors, highlighting their broad use in hunting and shooting sports and suggesting it is “archaic” to continue to regulate them via the National Firearms Act. Turk touched on M1 Garands,   1911s, and other U. S.   firearms that are in holding overseas, awaiting clearance to be shipped back to the U. S. and sold to citizens. He wrote: There is no clear public safety reason why     CR defense articles should be denied   to the American public, while many  . S.  origin CR items are approved. Additionally, these items do not represent any discernable public safety concern, as demand lies with collectors of vintage military firearms. Importation and sale through licensed dealers would effectively regulate the lawful transfer of these firearms through a licensee and a background check.

0,WELFake Dataset,"A seat in a subway car in Mexico City’s metro system caused a stir earlier this year. There were awkward glances. Visible discomfort. Baffled looks. Some laughs. And of course, the inevitable pictures from passengers’ camera phones. It was meant to be provocative, and it was. A seat was changed to look like the lower half of a male’s body, including the penis, part of a campaign by UN Women and the Mexico City government to raise awareness about sexual harassment on subways. On the floor beneath the seat, there was a sign reading, “It is annoying to travel this way, but not compared to the sexual violence women suffer in their daily commutes. ” The campaign has now released a video titled ”Experimento Asiento”  —   “an experiment with a seat”  —   that has had more than 800, 000 views on YouTube since March 20. It shows people reacting with a mixture of discomfort and shock throughout. One man even tried to cover the seat with a coat to sit on it. It didn’t work. He abandoned the seat, as did others who tried to sit in it during the experiment in January. UN Women and the Mexican government collaborated on a second video as well, which has also begun picking up traffic. It is called “Experimento Pantallas”  —   or “experiment screens. ” That experiment involved installing cameras that would take tight shots of male buttocks and display them on screens for all to see. In the video, a number of men are shown expressing disgust and embarrassment. “We wanted to do something different,” said a Yeliz Osman, a program coordinator with the Mexican UN Women office. “We wanted to target men because on a global level, the majority of programs talking about sexual violence or sexual harassment always target women and girls. We wanted to change that because we don’t think that women are the problem. ” The campaign is called #NoEsDeHombres (a rough translation would be “this isn’t manly”) and it is aimed at men, both with the video ads and with newly unveiled print ones that show guys giving lascivious looks with slogans like “this is how your mother gets looked at every day. ” These particular ads came about after UN Women and the Mexican government took open submissions for ideas on a campaign to target a male audience. Around 40 agencies submitted pitches and J. Walter Thompson won.  “We need to make clear that this is violent, not flattering, and incentivize men to intervene if they witness it” said Ana Güemez, director of the Mexican UN Women office, during the presentation of the campaign this Thursday. According to a national survey done in 2016 by the Mexican Institute of Women, Inmujeres, nine out of 10 women or girls who use public transportation feel unsafe while doing it. A   Reuters survey done in 2014 also showed that the Mexico City transport system is the   dangerous for women overall out of 15 world capitals. However, Mexico City was squarely in first place for specific questions like “have your been verbally harassed?” or “have you been groped?“ “In order to generate change, you need to create empathy,” Ms. Osman said. “The idea is that men can get a sense of what it is all like. By creating empathy, we hope that this might change their behavior. ” The Mexico City government has begun to take action: It is now possible to file an administrative complaint if you get catcalled (the perpetrator either pays a fine or spends a night in jail) and last year it started handing out rape whistles on the subway so that women could “warn of possible crimes” (a plan that was not without its critics). The issue has gained prominence in the past few weeks after a   blogger, Tamara de Anda, was publicly criticized for talking about filing a complaint against a taxi driver who accosted her verbally while she was walking down the street. Insults on social media ranged from telling her she wasn’t attractive enough to be offended by the driver’s catcall to issuing death threats. Ms. De Anda was one of several Mexican public figures who participated in the presentation of the #NoEsDeHombres campaign, alongside the wrestler El Hijo del Santo and the actor Alfonso Herrera, familiar to United States audiences from Netflix’s show, “Sense8. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

There’s playing with fire and there’s dousing yourself with gasoline and jumping into a flaming pit. I do the latter in a piece for SCMP’s This Week in Asia magazine, The British Forgery at the Heart of India and China’s Tibetan Border Dispute . 
My proposed title, Uncle Sam Plays the Great Game in Arunachal Pradesh, didn’t make the cut. 
In my piece I take the visit of the US Ambassador to India, Richard Verma, as an opportunity to unpack the history and significance of the 1914 Simla Convention between Great Britain, Tibet, and China, an imperial episode which also saw the birth of the notorious McMahon Line. 
The McMahon Line is notorious since India unilaterally—and with some help from the United States and zero agreement from the PRC—asserts that the McMahon Line is the indisputable boundary between India and the PRC in India’s Northeast. 
The McMahon Line is a hot-button issue for Tibetan nationalists as well, since Great Britain negotiated it directly with the government of Tibet, so supporting the McMahon Line delivers the dual benefits of supporting the narrative of the existence of a recognized independent Tibetan government and giving aid and comfort to the Tibetan diaspora’s Indian patron. 
The actual situation and significant consequence of the McMahon Line is complicated but, I believe, accessible thanks to some deft historical research by several scholars and despite some litigating by Indian and Tibetan partisans. 
Having said that, I welcome correction and instruction, so in this post I’m going to lay out the arguments behind the assertions in my SCMP piece in greater detail. For sourcing, I lean on Neville Maxwell India’s China War (Maxwell was the Times of London ’s India correspondent during the 1962 war and a key figure in revisionist analysis of the roots of the war), and an unpublished dissertation by Dr. Heather Spence, British policy and the ‘development’ of Tibet, 1912-1933, that I found very informative on the diplomatic and geopolitical context of the Great Britain-Tibet relationship pre-and-post-Simla. 
The story of the McMahon Line is inseparable from—but not identical with—the story of the Simla Convention negotiations between Great Britain—represented by Henry McMahon–China, and Tibet at the hill town of Simla in India in 1914. 
First off, the key and most interesting aspects of the Simla Convention are both the de facto independence of Tibet (which had expelled the Chinese by 1914 and had a government in Lhasa under the Dalai Lama with effective control over much of the area of Tibet)…and Great Britain’s consistent and overriding interest in denying de jure independence for Tibet. 
Great Britain was obsessed, perhaps unhealthily so, with playing the “Great Game”: forestalling the southern creep of Russian influence in Asia toward India. 
In India’s northeast, this translated into the desire to establish Tibet as a buffer state that was pro-British and secure. 
“Pro-British” was not an issue in 1914, since the Dalai Lama at the time was an ardent Anglophile who had spent several years of exile in the sympathetic company of the British administrator Charles Bell. 
“Secure” was the problem. The Raj had no interest in rolling the geopolitical dice by endorsing Tibetan independence and with it the possibility that a hostile new regime and adverse set of circumstances might bring the Chinese or Russians into Tibet and up to India’s doorstep; but it also lacked the will or capacity to assert and enforce a unilateral protectorate over Tibet. 
It was deemed necessary that, if and when China emerged from the chaos of the 1911 Revolution as a power-projecting state, it would acquiesce to the existence of an autonomous Tibetan government that had a special relationship with Great Britain. 
So Henry McMahon summoned Tibetan and Chinese representatives to Simla to order the relations between Tibet and China, and between Tibet and Great Britain. The Tibetans were eager to attend; the Chinese were compelled by McMahon’s threat that he would conclude a bilateral agreement with Tibet if they didn’t show up. 
One can speculate—and I will—that the Chinese showed up primarily to stall and throw a spanner in the works. Simla acknowledged China’s role—and also gave China the chance to act as the spoiler, by participating in the negotiations but refusing to endorse the outcome. 
The core of the British agenda at Simla was to partition Tibet into “Inner” and “Outer” Tibet as the Russians had just done with “Inner” and “Outer” Mongolia. Inner Tibet, the parts abutting Sichuan in which Chinese control was stronger, would be incorporated into China. Outer Tibet—the big part, the strategic part, the highlands run out of Lhasa by the Dalai Lama—would not become independent: it would be an autonomous government lacking control over its foreign affairs. 
Autonomy, but autonomy of a specific type was preferred. McMahon came up with the idea of “suzerainty”. 
“Suzerainty” served multiple purposes. By invoking a Chinese aegis, “suzerainty” was a legal fig leaf providing diplomatic cover to Great Britain, which had concluded an agreement with Russia in 1907 that promised neither state would conduct direct negotiations with the Tibetan government. At the same time, “suzerainty” was intended to forestall any claims from Russia and other nations that “Outer Tibet” was part of China and therefore subject to the Open Door policy declaring that the rights and access of one state in China were to be enjoyed by all. 
But most importantly, “suzerainty” was used to assert that, by China’s leave, Tibet would be autonomous, but still conduct its foreign affairs independently with respect to only to one, and only one country: Great Britain. 
So, in essence, the Simla Convention was designed to secure a special relationship between Great Britain and Tibet with Chinese endorsement to compensate for the fact that Great Britain lacked the resolve to secure Tibet as a formal British protectorate. 
The Chinese, however, did not endorse. The Chinese representative initialed the draft agreement, but the Chinese government withheld authorization to sign. 
To explain its refusal, the Chinese government placed the onus on the issue of boundary delimitation. 
The Chinese foreign affairs office formally notified Great Britain that “This Government has several times stated that it gives its support to the majority of the articles of the Convention. The part which it is unable to agree to is that dealing with the question of boundary. [Spence, pg. 36] 
I expect it was McMahon’s fallback plan from the gitgo to try to take in the bilateral what China refused to cede in the trilateral. 
McMahon had been instructed by London not to sign bilaterally with just Tibet, but he decided to exceed his instructions, concluding an agreement with Tibet that finessed the Chinese non-participation in the Simla Convention with a declaration that China, by not signing, had simply forfeited the privileges for China negotiated in the Convention. 
According to this formula, Great Britain and Tibet would execute the parts of the Convention that pertained to them—mainly diplomatic (Tibet would not enter into agreements with any other foreign power without Britain’s OK) and trade. The agreement waived all tariffs between British India and Tibet, a piece of free-trade maneuvering that advantaged the Raj but caused no small fiscal problems and resentment of the Tibetan government (which had relied on taxing exports of wool to India for a significant part of its revenue) in the 1920s. 
At Simla the Chinese representative, Ivan Chen, was excluded from these discussions, unaware of the content of the bilateral undertakings, and invited to go to a separate room while British and Tibetan representatives signed them. Unsurprisingly, he declared the Chinese government would not recognize any agreement concluded bilaterally between Great Britain and Tibet, a declaration that was repeated by the Chinese Minister in London. 
No one regarded the gains of the bilateral track as an adequate replacement for a trilateral pact. 
It was understood by all concerned—Great Britain, India, Tibet, China, indeed, McMahon himself—Simla was a bust. McMahon reported to London: 
It is with great regret that I leave India without having secured the formal adherence of the Chinese Government to a Tripartite Agreement…The fact is that the negotiations at Simla…broke down… [Maxwell, 49] 
Mindful that without China’s formal participation the agreement at Simla was in conflict with the 1907 convention with Russia, Great Britain did not publish the Simla Convention. Instead, it belatedly took notice of the negotiations in its official compendium, Aitchison’s Treaties and Sanads 1929 Edition Volume XIV , with the terse remark: “The convention was initialled and sealed on 3 July 1914. As this Convention was not signed and ratified by all three parties, the current Chinese Government does not consider itself bound by the terms of this convention.” 
As for the McMahon Line, it was a separate bilateral sideshow to the main issue of trying to demarcate a border between Tibet and China a.k.a. “Inner” and “Outer” Tibet trilaterally at Simla. 
Prior to and contemporaneously with the tripartite negotiations on the Simla Convention, the British and Tibetan teams had conducted bilateral discussions in Delhi and Simla as to the position of the boundary between India and Tibet. 
Since Great Britain regarded Tibet as de facto autonomous in its dealings with Great Britain (and presumably hopeful the special relationship would be shortly confirmed at Simla as de jure ) , no effort was made during the negotiations to involve China, with rather disastrous implications for the future. 
In 1962, India would be facing not the Tibetan government across the McMahon Line but the People’s Republic of China, which with very good reason considered itself in no way bound as a successor to any previous border negotiations. 
With equally disastrous consequences for Nehru and India in 1962, McMahon, instead of drawing the boundary in the foothills of the Himalayas, drew it along the crestline, in easy reach of attackers from the north but virtually indefensible from the south. 
The key horsetrading occurred in the matter of the “Tawang Tract”. Tawang was an indisputable locus of Tibetan control, with a big monastery dominating a fertile valley at the southern reaches of the Tibetan plateau and also dominating, in a less than admirable way, a local population of ethnic Manpo serfs exploited in the most dire fashion. 
By virtue of its riverine topography, Tawang straddled an important trade route between Lhasa and northern India and was therefore seen as a potential military threat/power point that the Raj wished to control. 
In the bilateral British-Tibetan boundary discussions, the western terminus of McMahon’s line crept north until it included all of Tawang. The Tibetan delegation was apparently not happy about this state of affairs but accepted it as the price of British support and with the reassurance that they could continue to tax Tawang despite its inclusion into British India. The Indian-Tibetan boundary agreement was enshrined in an 8 mile to the inch map and held in two copies, one by the British and one in Lhasa. 
The McMahon Line was introduced into the Simla negotiations through the back door, as it were, by presenting it as a fait accompli on the large-scale map intended for attachment to the Simla Convention as a continuation of the crucial line defining the boundary between Inner and Outer Tibet which had indeed been the subject of genuine tripartite negotiations. 
Interestingly, the British and Tibetans also bilaterally extended the boundary to enclose Aksai Chin, a barren waste to the west of Tibet, as Tibetan (not Indian) territory in order to give Tibet the incentive or responsibility to keep the Russians out of that sensitive strategic area. 
Ivan Chen initialed the treaty and map—the sole, shaky basis for India’s subsequent insistence that China had accepted the McMahon Line—but was rebuked by Peking for exceeding his instructions and, as noted above, declined to sign the final Convention. 
At the time, as recorded in Aitchison, it was universally understood that China had rejected the Simla Convention, and that this was a problem that overshadowed whatever informal gains had accrued to Britain through the bilateral agreements with Tibet. We know this thanks to documents demonstrating that both the Tibetans and Great Britain clung to the Simla “suzerainty” gambit, and that they labored fruitlessly for decades to get China back to the negotiating table to validate the policy. 
The key concern was that China, by refusing to sign the tripartite Simla Convention, had refused to countenance the Inner/Outer Tibet arrangement that would have fixed the Sino-Tibetan border, assured the autonomy and security of the government in Lhasa– and justified to Lhasa Great Britain’s extensive, unique, and increasingly onerous diplomatic and trading privileges in “Outer Tibet”. 
Immediately subsequent to the Simla negotiations, 1915, internal British correspondence characterized the Simla Convention as “invalid” [Spence, pg. 59] and, in the context of the Great War, without basis as an obligation for arming Lhasa to forestall Chinese mischief. In 1919, the Tibetan chief minister evocatively expressed his concern that Tibet would find itself abandoned “like tiny fledglings on an open plain.” [Spence, pg. 48] 
As for China, instead of returning to negotiations and acquiescing to “suzerainity” over a virtually independent Tibet–an arrangement it was perhaps only pretending to countenance before it backed out at Simla, when China was flat on its back and the Raj was at its zenith—it preferred to mass troops on Tibet’s Sichuan frontier and agitate for direct engagement with Lhasa. 
It soon became apparent that China was, shall we say, the “rising power” in the Himalayan regions, the British were the “declining power”, and it became a matter of considerable anxiety in Lhasa that China was piling up troops in the eastern marches and the Tibetan government was being forced to confront these forces without any significant military or diplomatic support from Great Britain. 
Faced with niggardly and tardy provision of guns and ammunition by Great Britain, Lhasa began playing footsie with Russia and Japan via Mongolia to pursue the supply of arms; amazingly, Great Britain was able to veto these initiatives thanks to the special position in Tibetan security affairs it had negotiated bilaterally at Simla. 
The Tibetan government came to understand that the Simla Convention and the idea that Britain had the sincerity and capacity to protect Tibet against China were, at best, on life support. 
By 1936, a British political officer reported on the mood in Lhasa as follows: 
They regarded the adjustment of the Tibet-Indian boundary as part and parcel of the general adjustment and determination of boundaries contemplated in the 1914 Convention. If they could, with our help, secure a definite Sino-Tibetan boundary they would of course be glad to observe the Indo-Tibetan border as defined in 1914… [Maxwell, 59] 
With Simla moribund, the McMahon Line was never demarcated on the ground and as a result it never acquired any customary force as a precedent. 
Notably, there were no serious efforts to assert effective British rule in the remote tribal reaches of the McMahon line, or even over Tawang until the 1930s. Then, with the Japanese menace replacing Russia as the focus of the Great Britain’s anxieties concerning northern encroachment, the Raj adopted a policy which might be characterized as “F*ck Tibet”: unilaterally extending British control northwards without reference to the original and unrealized vision of backing Tibet in return for the trade and territorial privileges that Great Britain had negotiated two decades before. 
At this point, Olaf Caroe enters the picture. Caroe was a key official in the British Raj and an enthusiastic geopolitical strategist. In 1935, Tibetan authorities in Tawang arrested a British spy/botanist and the government in Lhasa made the decision, unwise in retrospect, to issue a protest to the British authorities and thereby bring Lhasa’s claims to Tawang to Caroe’s attention. 
In response, Caroe pulled off a rather notorious subterfuge in order to buttress the British claim to Tawang: he published the Simla Convention for the first time in 1938 with a note misrepresenting that it had included settlement of the border (and alienation of Tawang); and he arranged for the publication of official Survey of India maps that, for the first time, showed the McMahon Line as the official boundary. To advance the narrative, he also corresponded with commercial atlas publishers to put the McMahon Line on their maps as well. 
In a telling indication of Caroe’s jiggery-pokery, to avoid the awkward question of why he was first publishing the Simla Convention twenty-four years after the fact in 1938, he instead arranged for the surreptitious printing of a spurious back-dated edition of Aitchison , deleting the original note about the Chinese government’s non-signature, and replacing it with a lengthy note stating, quite falsely, that “The [Simla] Convention included a definition of boundaries…” 
Since 1) the McMahon Line had been concluded in secret bilateral negotiations between Tibet and Great Britain outside the Convention and 2) the Chinese had officially refused to recognize any bilateral agreement, boundary or otherwise, between Tibet and Great Britain and 3) had declined to sign the Simla Convention itself and 4) had notified Great Britain in 1914 that the specific sticking point was “the boundaries” this was hoo-hah. 
The replacement copy was distributed to various libraries with instructions to withdraw and destroy the original edition. 
The subterfuge was only discovered in 1963 when J.A. Addis, a British diplomat, discovered a surviving copy of the original edition at Harvard and compared it to Caroe’s version. 
That was too late for Nehru, who apparently sincerely accepted Caroe’s maps as holy writ i.e. the accurate depiction of borders that had been trilaterally negotiated at Simla, published, openly acknowledged, and a moral imperative and worthy object of Indian military defense in 1962. 
It was also too late for Harvard’s own John Kenneth Galbraith, who as ambassador to India successfully lobbied President Kennedy to declare the McMahon Line as India’s recognized border, apparently as part of his campaign to support India and elevate the PRC-India conflict beyond the mundane sphere of “clash over disputed border” to “Chicom aggression against India”. 
In response to Galbraith’s urgings, President Kennedy overrode the concerns of the State Department and the vociferous objections of Chiang Kai-shek on Taiwan (the government of China in 1962 as far as the US was concerned) to give Galbraith the leeway to announce “The McMahon Line is the accepted international border and is sanctioned by modern usage. Accordingly we regard it as the northern border of the [North East Frontier Agency] region.” 
Well, “accepted international border sanctioned by modern usage” is something of a stretch. As noted above, not only the Chinese but the Tibetan government of the 1930s, itself to be extinguished by the Chinese in 1959, regarded the McMahon Line as a dead letter. 
In discussions with Nehru in the 1950s, Zhou Enlai had made the rather telling statement that “he had never heard of the McMahon Line”. The Chinese government only understood the full extent of the boundary understandings between the Tibetan and British governments in 1914 after the PLA seized documents in the Potala Palace during the 1959 invasion, and Zhou subsequently declared the McMahon Line a piece of imperial fraud. Imperial historians—Addis, Maxwell, and Lamb–had the opportunity to examine British records a few years later, when the fifty-year embargo on government records expired, and agreed with Zhou. 
The revelation of these contacts made a good case for de facto Tibetan independence between the two world wars; unfortunately, they also at the same time clearly demonstrated that the Chinese government had never been party to them, or to the McMahon Line. 
Much has been made in Indian and Tibetan nationalist circles of Zhou Enlai’s willingness to use the McMahon Line as the basis for a border settlement between India and the PRC. However, this had nothing to do with any acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the line (which, after all, had never been demarcated in the field) and perhaps had something to do with the fact that, as the 1962 war demonstrated, the task of defending the McMahon Line on the edge of the Tibetan plateau is a tremendous strategic burden for India. 
The truth about the legal and military aspects of the 1962 Sino-Indian War are, I would venture, still a matter of denial and disinformation, especially in India. The Henderson-Brooks Report, which details the strategic and operational failings of the Indian military establishment in 1962, has never been declassified, despite Prime Minister Modi’s previous promises in that regard; only portions of it are in the public domain thanks to Neville Maxwell, who somehow got his hands on a copy. 
Asserting the purported sanctity of the McMahon Line (and Chinese perfidy in refusing to honor it) is a staple of the patriotic narrative. 
In its combination of nationalist posturing and pseudo-historical bullsh*t, the Indian position on the McMahon Line bookends the PRC’s claims in the South China Sea in interesting ways. 
And, of course, the United States, as part of its pro-India/anti-China tilt is more interested in enabling the myths of the McMahon Line than supporting resolution of the Sino-Indian border dispute through equitable negotiation.

0,WELFake Dataset,"NIAMEY/DAKAR (Reuters) - Chad has withdrawn hundreds of troops from neighboring Niger, where they were helping local forces fight Boko Haram Islamist militants, humanitarian sources and officials said. The pull-out over the past two weeks could weaken a region-wide struggle against the militants who have killed tens of thousands of people, forced many more to flee and triggered a humanitarian crisis. There was no immediate explanation or comment from defense officials in Chad. But the move came a month after the vast central African country complained about an unexpected U.S. travel ban imposed on its nationals. Chad warned at the time the order could affect its security commitments - which include its involvement in the U.S.-backed fight against Boko Haram. Residents said the withdrawal had already had an impact on Niger s Diffa region, which has seen a string of attacks by Boko Haram militants crossing over from their base in neighboring Nigeria. Ibrahim Arimi from the border village of Bosso said banditry had increased since the Chadian troops started leaving and he had been temporarily moved to another village for safety. Diffa parliamentarian Lamido Moumouni said residents had started complaining.  They have come to rely on the forces so there is a perception that security will be lacking,  he said by telephone. At its peak in 2016 after an attack in Bosso, Chad had 2,000 troops in Niger to help counter Boko Haram although security sources said this has fallen since. Boko Haram has attacked Chad, Niger and Cameroon from its base in northeast Nigeria. Its eight-year bid to carve out an Islamist caliphate has driven millions from their homes - more than 200,000 of them are now based in Diffa, with little prospect of returning home.  Thousands of them are camped alongside an unfinished highway in the middle of a barren savannah with few resources.  Chad s soldiers also occupy front-line positions in a peacekeeping force in northern Mali. Falling oil revenues after the price crash in 2014 has also sapped Chad s appetite for expensive regional security commitments, analysts say. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

If you ve ever seen footage of this sort of thing happening to someone, it s better described as  he decided to play his role and spouted some gibberish just before making a complete fool of himself. The prophet threw caution to the wind and charged at a pack of lions who were happily chomping on an impala they had taken down. Ndiwane ran towards them, believing the dominion over animals granted by God to man would keep him safe. As he ran screaming towards the pack, several of the animals decided he looked rather tasty, charging towards him instead of running away. When Ndiwane realized there was some serious tonnage worth of teeth and claws headed his way, he miraculously snapped out of his trance and turned tail towards safety.Not only did God not give Ndiwane power over the lions, he also failed to give him the speed to get away clean. A female lion got in a good swipe and ruined the rest of the trip, sending Ndiwane to the hospital with major damage to his glutes.

There hasn't been much to cheer about in Nepal this week as it copes with a devastating earthquake — but cheers and applause broke out in Kathmandu Thursday after a teenager was pulled alive from a collapsed building.

For five days, the teenager was covered in the rubble of a seven-story building hit by Saturday's powerful quake. Rescue workers who got him out included an American disaster response team that arrived in Nepal this week.

""The leader of the USAID-sponsored American team was quoted as saying they sent in a camera to find the safest way to extract the teen,"" NPR's Julie McCarthy reports.

""It's what we call an entombment,"" Andrew Olvera, who leads the American team that was involved, tells The Associated Press. ""So, he wasn't specifically crushed. What he was, was inside of a box — a box with heavy concrete all around him.""

Rescuers had to use jacks to pry away the building's concrete and free the teen, whose age has been variously reported as 18 or 15. The teenager was strapped to a stretcher and was reportedly ""dazed"" but responsive.

Olvera said his team worked alongside the Nepali crew. The U.S. team includes emergency workers from Los Angeles County and Fairfax County, Va., CBS News reports. USAID said this week that it sent nearly 130 people to Nepal.

Earlier, there had been reports that a second person had been rescued, but those reports have not been confirmed.

The good news comes along with reports of fuel shortages, heavy traffic on the roads around Kathmandu and congestion at its airport — a situation that aid officials say is hampering the relief effort.

Relief aid group Oxfam ""says it is looking at ways to transport essential goods overland from India,"" the AP reports. ""It says challenges include getting aid to remote mountain villages, many of which are connected to the outside world by a single dirt road that may now be blocked by landslides.""

The U.N. launched an appeal for $415 million in emergency funds on Wednesday, to help Nepal cope with the disaster that has killed more than 5,500 people and injured more than 11,000 others, destroyed 70,000 houses and damaged an additional 530,000. Hundreds of thousands of people are reportedly living in rudimentary shelter.

Handler, clearly noticing this coded language and how pathetic it is for someone to try to prove themselves in this manner, called him out perfectly.

0,WELFake Dataset,"PARIS (Reuters) - In the modernist but faded headquarters of UNESCO, the U.N. s cultural agency on Paris s elegant Left Bank, more than a few diplomats wandered the corridors on Friday wondering if the organization has a future. The agency, founded in the ashes of World War Two to protect the common cultural inheritance of humanity, was due to elect a new head later in the day. But a sudden announcement that the United States was quitting over anti-Israel bias meant that whoever wins the top job would inherit a body in turmoil, with huge questions over its future funding and mission.  I think it s a catastrophic decision,  said Daniel Rondeau, a former French envoy to the body.  It s a fracture that seriously jeopardizes the very nature of UNESCO - its universal dimension - and the very concept of multilateralism.  Officially known as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO is best known for designating and protecting archaeological and heritage sites, from the Galapagos Islands to the tombs of Timbuktu. Most of its activities are uncontroversial, but when it comes to, say, resolutions about how religious sites should be run in Jerusalem, every word is studied for accusations of bias. For some of its diplomats, Washington s decision to quit represented a corner being turned, and puts even more pressure on whoever is elected to lead it.  This is the most critical election. There can t be four more years like this,  said a Western diplomat, bemoaning the leadership of outgoing director Irina Bokova of Bulgaria, whose critics say she failed to persuade member states to pay their dues and stop politicizing UNESCO s work. At the heart of its recent problems is a financing crisis since 2011, when UNESCO voted to admit Palestine as a full member state and Washington responded by halting payment of its annual $80 million in dues. The United States and Israel were among just 14 of 194 members to vote against Palestine s membership. Washington says it favors an independent Palestinian state some day, but it must arise from negotiations, and admitting the Palestinians to international bodies beforehand hurts the peace process. Since then, Israel has regularly complained over resolutions about cultural sites in the West Bank and Jerusalem, arguing that they are worded to delegitimize the Jewish state. Israel s foes say it uses U.S. support to deflect bona fide criticism. Without U.S. money, UNESCO, which employs around 2,000 people worldwide, has been forced to cut programs, freeze hiring and fill gaps with voluntary contributions. Its 2017 budget was about $326 million, almost half its 2012 budget.  We need to do less with less. We ve spent too long trying to do too much without the means,  said a UNESCO official, who declined to be identified.  We need to sell ourselves better, but without funding it s difficult to change our image.   Including the United States, which has some $542 million in arrears, the organization is owed almost $650 million, according to figures on its website. At this stage, UNESCO officials still don t know if the United States will make up its arrears before it officially exits on Dec. 31, 2018.  Other major contributors such as Japan, Britain, and Brazil have also yet to pay their dues for 2017, sometimes citing objections to the body s policies.  The fact is that UNESCO was all about solidarity and creating a climate for peace between countries, but nations now use their dues to influence programs,  said a UNESCO-based diplomat.  That needs to change.  Japan, for example, has threatened to withhold dues over the inclusion of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre in the body s  Memory of the World  program. Russia and Ukraine have been at odds over Crimea, with Kiev accusing Moscow of trying to legitimize its annexation of the territory through UNESCO.  Whoever takes over at the helm has to tackle this head on. They need to find ways of getting nations to talk these issues through, but if they can t, then the director-general needs to be able to say  no  and kill these texts,  said a second UNESCO-based diplomat. Unlike at the U.N. Security Council, where five powers wield a veto, UNESCO takes decisions based on majority votes, either of its General Secretariat that includes all 195 nations, or of the 58-member Executive Board. Israel says this creates a built-in majority for states that are hostile to it. Big countries like the United States that provide most of the funding say their single votes give them little input into how their money is spent. Prior to Thursday s U.S. decision to withdraw, UNESCO s board had tried to evade confrontation by voting to postpone divisive Israeli-Palestinian texts until April, diplomats said. All the candidates running to head UNESCO have vowed grassroots reforms and efforts to de-politicize the institution. The final candidates are two former culture ministers from France and Qatar. But even the vote on a new boss is tinged with politics, since Egypt, which has also vied for the top post, and Qatar are on opposite sides in a diplomatic dispute in the Arab world.

0,WELFake Dataset,"LONDON (Reuters) - A project looking at links between mental health and terrorism in three English cities has been expanded nationwide after it found a significant number of people referred to counter-radicalization programs suffer some form of mental illness. Studies have suggested the prevalence of mental health issues among militants working together on major strikes is very low but a string of killings by so-called lone wolves has fueled concerns mental illness could be a factor behind some attacks. Authorities say some of those involved in four attacks in Britain this year blamed on Islamist militants appeared to people who had self-radicalized via the internet and whose mental state had been questioned. To look more closely at the issue, British police launched pilot programs in April last year in England s three biggest urban areas - London, Birmingham and Manchester - to embed mental health experts with counter-terrorism officers. The aim was to give psychiatrists the chance to identify people referred to Britain s counter-radicalization program Prevent who had mental health issues, and treat them.  Anecdotally, I am surprised that there appears to be a much higher prevalence of people with mental health problems than you would expect,  said Professor Jennifer Shaw, the mental health lead for Greater Manchester Police, referring to the people her team had dealt with since the pilot was launched. The hubs are considered so successful by the government they have been expanded nationwide, Shaw, professor of forensic psychiatry at the University of Manchester, told Reuters. But such is the secrecy around the work of Prevent and Channel - a de-radicalization program within the overall project - there are few details about its successes or failings and Shaw s work has not previously been discussed in the media. Some psychiatrists argue that no scientific link between mental health issues and terrorist attacks has yet been established and they worry the programs risk stigmatizing people suffering from mental illnesses. Another psychiatrist gathering data under the pilot programs told Reuters that Britain s Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism had told them not to disclose any details of their findings ahead of a final report. Those findings are expected to be among a raft of data about people referred to Prevent due to be released this week. Britain s interior ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Dr Adrian James, registrar at Britain s Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP), said the link between mental health problems and terrorist acts had not been established.  He said a lack of evidence, partly because militant attacks were so rare, was at the heart of the problem, adding that an unnecessary level of secrecy about Prevent also meant many psychiatrists viewed the program with suspicion.  If it is true that there is a link, we need to know and then need to look at the causes of that and what we can do about them,  James told Reuters.  We just want the facts.  Past studies have disagreed about the significance of mental health issues among lone wolf attackers, with some academics concluding that such illnesses are blamed to try to explain often complex reasons for attacks. British police decided to launch the pilot programs because they believed that roughly half the 7,500 people referred to Prevent each year had a broad range of mental health and psychological difficulties. Those working on the pilot projects hope the information being gathered will now help experts assess any possible links between mental health issues and attacks. Shaw said determining who might be a potential attacker from mental health problems alone was not really feasible and fraught with problems, but she said it might be possible to ascertain the characteristics of people most likely to be at risk and ensure they got appropriate help.  That doesn t mean you can t manage the risks. Trying to nip it in the bud, that s all you can do. But that s good if you can achieve that, it s going a long way,  said Shaw. Police officers say they have struggled in the past to reach medical practitioners when they had concerns about some people and Shaw said the pilot was designed to address those worries. According to one of Shaw s case studies, a man went to a hospital saying he monitored Islamic State websites, had been walking around the city center working out how many people he could kill in a gun attack, and wanted to behead his mother. Shaw s team discovered the man had no contact with mental health services and no diagnosis of any illness. An urgent assessment concluded his anger stemmed from experiences in his childhood and safeguarding measures were put in place.  British police have no doubts about the importance of the work, especially given the global shift from carefully planned spectacular attacks by militant networks to unsophisticated, strikes by individuals using cars and knives as weapons. Mark Rowley, Britain s most senior counter-terrorism officer, told the British Medical Journal in April that a disproportionate number of suspects in 13 attacks foiled by British police since 2013 had mental health issues.  If part of the terrorist methodology is to prey on the vulnerable ... then it stands to reason that there will be people with certain mental health conditions who will be ... susceptible to that,  he said.  Radicalizing and inciting someone who is vulnerable to go and carry out some ghastly attack seems to be part of their tactics, and that has brought in a whole load of vulnerability issues, including mental health, that we now have to wrestle with,  said Rowley. A study by University College London s (UCL) Department of Security and Crime Science looked at 55 attacks involving 76 individuals between May 2014 and September 2016 where reports had shown the perpetrators may have been influenced by IS. The study found 34 percent of those involved in attacks inspired by Islamic State - rather than actually directed by the militant group - had mental health issues. Health experts estimate about one in four people will suffer some form of mental health issue and those with mental illnesses are generally less likely to commit violent crimes than the overall population. Shaw said those with mental health issues and developmental disorders referred to her team at Prevent were more likely to be suffering from psychosis and autism, adding that people with serious mental illnesses often had tiny social networks.  They can therefore, when unwell, be influenced by messages that go out that say come and belong to our group. It can be quite compelling. The same for people with autism. The internet kind of way of getting the message out makes those people, particularly vulnerable. So I think that s a big issue.  Psychiatrists worry that all people with mental health issues could be stigmatized and considered potential militants, possibly deterring them from seeking help. Prevent, one of the four strands of Britain s counter-terrorism strategy known as Contest launched in 2003, has also been dogged by claims it is used to spy on Muslim communities. A government edict in 2015 instructing public bodies such as schools, health workers and universities to raise any concerns they have about individuals with the authorities has exacerbated those concerns. Shaw acknowledged more work was needed on the outcomes of their mental health interventions under the Prevent pilot programs to determine what made a difference. Asked if people her team had treated might have committed violent acts if their conditions had not been addressed, she said:  That is the obvious question. You can t say that in any kind of scientific way.  We re attempting to try and get at that. Is it completely to do with their mental illness, half to do with it, or not at all?  said Shaw.  We have had cases where people have had ideologies, they have also had a mental health problem, and they are not linked at all. The last thing we need is  all these bombers are nutters . We don t want that going on.  ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false. I know the correct answer, but I want to check your ability to identify true or false information.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Home / Be The Change / Mark Ruffalo Delivers Mobile Solar Trailers to Standing Rock Camps in Preparation for Harsh Winter Mark Ruffalo Delivers Mobile Solar Trailers to Standing Rock Camps in Preparation for Harsh Winter Jay Syrmopoulos October 30, 2016 2 Comments 
Cannon Ball, ND – In a show of kindness and solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux, actor Mark Ruffalo and Native Renewables founder Wahleah Johns presented Sioux tribal elders with mobile trailers equipped with solar collection arrays. The trailers provide a clean energy source for the protest encampment where over 500 Native American tribes have taken a stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline in the largest gathering of American Indians in modern history. 
“This pipeline is a black snake that traverses four states and 200 waterways with fracked Bakken oil,” said Ruffalo, co-founder of The Solutions Project, a venture that works to transition society to clean and renewable energy. 
“We know from experience that pipelines leak, explode, pollute and poison land and water. But it doesn’t have to be that way.” 
The solar trailers will allow for medical tents and numerous other critical facilities to be powered with clean energy, and represent exactly the healthy/abundant future of energy for which the Standing Rock Sioux are currently fighting. 
“Water is life,” said Johns, a Navajo leader. “By leading a transition to energy that is powered by the sun, the wind and water, we ensure a better future for all of our people and for future generations.” 
According to a report by EcoWatch : 
Johns’ company, Native Renewables, promotes low-cost clean energy solutions for Native American families throughout the U.S., with an emphasis on job creation and on benefiting the community as a whole. The trailers were built by members of the Navajo nation and were financed by Empowered by Light and Give Power. 
Research led by Stanford Prof. Mark Jacobson, another Solutions Project co-founder, shows that it would be technically possible and economically beneficial to transition to 100 percent clean renewable energy in each and every state across the country. In North Dakota, for example, wind and solar energy would be the primary sources of clean power and transitioning to 100 percent renewables would create 30,000 jobs. 
The reality of the situation is that the Standing Rock tribe is fighting to protect their source of clean water. The Dakota Access Pipeline puts the tribe’s clean water supply, as well as that of millions of others, in danger, as the pipeline is scheduled to go directly under the Missouri River. 
— Dan Zukowski (@danzukowski) October 25, 2016 
The construction of the “black snake” marks the conglomeration of corporate/banking interests being elevated above that of the public interest. Furthermore, the ongoing construction has already desecrated sacred burial sites and cultural artifacts. “Around the world, more than 80 percent of the forests and lands with protected waterways and rich biodiversity are held by indigenous tribes. This is no coincidence,” Ruffalo said. “As so many of us suffer from polluted water, air and land in our rural and urban communities, the water defenders at Standing Rock are showing us another way.” 
Imagine how you would respond if an oil pipeline was being dug through the cemetery where your grandparents and great grandparents were buried. 
Mark Ruffalo taking a stand for the Standing Rock Sioux is a great example for all individuals, celebrity, and non-celebrity alike. Rather than simply donating some money to a cause, he has utilized his celebrity to bring much greater attention to the continued injustices being perpetrated against the Native American community. 
It’s clear that Ruffalo has taken a page out of Ghandi’s book, and is “being the change he wishes to see in the world.”

0,WELFake Dataset,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California filed a lawsuit on Wednesday over the Trump administration’s plan to construct a wall along the border with Mexico, adding to the obstacles facing one of the Republican president’s key campaign promises. President Donald Trump has insisted Mexico would pay for building the wall, which experts said could cost about $22 billion and take more than three years to complete. With Mexico refusing to pay, Trump has said since taking office in January that the wall will initially need U.S. funding but that he will find a way to make Mexico ultimately pay for it. Democrats in the U.S. Congress, however, firmly oppose the border wall, and at least some Democratic senators would need to vote for its inclusion in a spending package. Democratic attorneys general including California’s Xavier Becerra have sued the Trump administration on a range of issues.  The border wall lawsuit filed in a San Diego federal court alleges that Trump’s wall violates federal environmental standards, as well as constitutional provisions regarding the separation of powers and states’ rights. Representatives for the U.S. Justice Department declined to immediately comment on the case. The lawsuit asks a judge to stop the administration from building the wall until it demonstrates compliance with environmental laws, and issue an order that the Department of Homeland Security cannot waive any federal guidelines in order to facilitate the project. Last month the Trump administration said it had selected four construction companies to build concrete prototypes for a wall, which will be will be 30 feet (9 meters) tall and about 30 feet wide and will be tested in San Diego.

0,WELFake Dataset,"The celebrated artist Peter Doig did not create a    landscape painting, despite the claims of the former corrections officer who owns it, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday. As a result, he was not responsible for destroying the plaintiffs’ plan to sell the work for millions of dollars. The ruling, after seven days of heated and sometimes bizarre testimony in federal court this month in Chicago, would appear to end one of the stranger art authentication cases in recent history. It had pitted Mr. Doig, a   artist whose works routinely sell for $10 million, against the owner of the painting and that man’s art dealer. They had accused Mr. Doig of falsely denying that he had created the work as a young man in Canada, thus scuttling their efforts to sell it. “Peter Doig could not have been the author of this work,” Judge Gary Feinerman said. Mr. Doig, who was not in court but called in to hear the ruling, said from Rome by telephone that he felt angry that he had been forced to prove he had not painted the work. “I feel a living artist should be the one who gets to say yea or nay and not be taken to task and forced to go back 40 years in time. It was painstaking to piece this together,” he said. Mr. Doig, 57, who was born in Britain and grew up in Canada and Trinidad, has created haunted, magical landscapes that have made him among the world’s most popular artists. During the trial, the former corrections officer, Robert Fletcher, sought to prove that the painting, an untitled acrylic on canvas of a rocky desert scene, signed “Pete Doige 76,” was an early work by Mr. Doig. Mr. Fletcher said he met Mr. Doig in the 1970s, when, he said, the artist was attending Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario, about 900 miles northwest of Toronto. According to Mr. Fletcher, they met again when Mr. Doig was serving a brief sentence for LSD possession at a nearby correctional center, where Mr. Fletcher saw him create the painting. Later, serving as Mr. Doig’s parole officer, Mr. Fletcher said he had helped the artist land a job and bought the painting for $100. Five years ago, a friend noticed the painting hanging on Mr. Fletcher’s wall and told him that the work was by a famous artist. In 2013, Mr. Fletcher and Peter Bartlow, the Chicago art dealer who agreed to help him sell the painting, filed suit in United States District Court for Northern Illinois, arguing that Mr. Doig was denying authorship because of a vendetta against Mr. Fletcher. Seeking nearly $8 million in damages and a court declaration that the work was authentic, Mr. Fletcher testified during the trial that he felt disrespected by Mr. Doig because the artist did not show any gratitude to Mr. Fletcher for setting him on a path toward fame and riches. Mr. Doig told the court that he had never attended Lakehead nor been incarcerated. Instead, he and his lawyers said the work in question was painted by another man, Peter Edward Doige, who died in 2012. One of Mr. Doige’s sisters produced evidence at trial that her brother was at Lakehead University, and testified that he was an inmate at the correctional center, that he liked to paint and that the signature on the work was his. And a former art teacher at the corrections center recalled watching it being painted by Mr. Doige over at least five weeks between 1976 and 1977. That the case ever went to trial surprised many in the art world. Authentication disputes tend to involve the works of dead artists. In this case, a very alive Mr. Doig found himself forced to prove that he did not create something. To show that he had not been in prison in the 1970s, Mr. Doig dredged up a school yearbook his mother’s letters about his appearing in “Romeo and Juliet” at his Toronto high school and working on oil rigs in western Canada and friends’ written testimony about his skiing in Utah. The plaintiffs’ response was to take up many hours of the trial with somewhat unorthodox efforts to demonstrate similarities between the painting and Mr. Doig’s works. The plaintiffs had also argued that rather than hiding youthful drug use  —   which Mr. Doig has admitted  —   or a prison past, the artist was embarrassed by the painting because he had used it as the basis for many other works. The plaintiffs’ case was weakened, art market experts said, because they could produce only one expert witness to authenticate the painting as a Doig. That witness, Mr. Bartlow, proved problematic: He was one of the plaintiffs, and  —   as revealed during the trial  —   had a 25 percent interest in any proceeds. The judge’s ruling said any similarities between the desert scene and Mr. Doig’s paintings were “purely coincidental. ” William F. Zieske, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said they were disappointed by the ruling and had not decided yet whether to appeal. “I still think the painting may be authentic,” he said. Had the decision gone against Mr. Doig, its effects would have reverberated throughout the art world, experts said. Such a decision could have set an uncomfortable precedent, potentially emboldening others to claim that a seemingly familiar painting on a living room wall was in fact by a   artist. “Other artists will be breathing a big sigh of relief,” said Nicholas M. O’Donnell, a Boston art lawyer.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false. I know the correct answer, but I want to check your ability to identify true or false information.

The Vice President, though, couldn t hold his opinion. He took to Twitter and said exactly what most women are thinking about Donald Trump s disgusting remarks about  grabbing  women by the  pussy.  Joe Biden called it sexual assault.The words are demeaning. Such behavior is an abuse of power. It s not lewd. It s sexual assault.  Joe  Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 8, 2016Much of the media (and Republicans) is treating the tape, in which Trump is heard talking about groping women and kissing them, without permission, as just more words. It s Trump as usual, they say, only raw and on steroids. The problem with that, though, is that Trump is describing criminal acts. He s clearly in the habit of using his power and money to take anything he wants, and women to Trump are just things.Biden has long been an advocate of women s rights. He has been a driving force behind helping to end the backlog of unprocessed rape kits.Biden was also key in the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in the Senate and calls it  the proudest thing I ve ever done.  His goal is to change the culture in this country. When a woman is raped, when a woman is abused, the first thing other women ask is what did you do? Why were you there? What were you wearing?  Biden said.  Folks, all the opportunity and entrepreneurship in the world is good. But ultimately, starting in this country, we have to change the culture. And we re not going to change that culture until not a single woman who is abused ever asks herself:  What did I do?

0,WELFake Dataset,"TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Hondurans spilled into the streets of the capital on Monday night, banging pots and pans and joining rebel police in defiance of a curfew imposed after a presidential election that was heavily criticized by the Organization of American States. Some police officers abandoned their posts and joined carnival-like demonstrations that erupted across the city hours after night fell and the curfew was supposed to have begun.   A statement issued in the name of the National Police said the officers were upset with the government over a political crisis that was not their responsibility.  Our people are sovereign,  said a member of the elite Cobra riot police, reading the statement.  We cannot confront and repress their rights.  Authorities finished counting votes on Monday after a week of increasingly widespread criticism about the Nov. 26 election, with Organization of American States (OAS) lending credence to opposition claims the government manipulated the results to ensure a win.   The tight margin, along with the irregularities, errors and systematic problems that have surrounded this election, does not allow the mission to be certain about the results,  said former Bolivian President Jorge Quiroga, heading the OAS election observation mission in the Central American country. Electoral authorities said President Juan Orlando Hernandez won 42.98 percent of the vote, compared with opposition challenger Salvador Nasralla s 41.39 percent, based on 99.96 percent of ballot boxes tallied. However, authorities refrained from declaring a winner, with Nasralla s center-left opposition Alliance demanding a wide recount of nearly a third of votes, a request backed by the OAS and European Union election observers.  Lending more support to that view, a leader of rebellious Cobra riot police told reporters the country wanted a vote-by-vote recount to clarify the results, and called on the armed forces to come out in support of the police protest.  The Alliance, which claims that results sheets from ballot boxes were altered, is expected to formally contest the results.  President Hernandez, who has been praised by the United States for his crackdown on street gangs, also refrained from calling himself the winner on Monday, despite claiming victory several times since the election.    I make a call for peace, for brotherhood, for sanity, for national unity,  he told reporters. In a striking sign of support for Hernandez, 49, the U.S. State Department cleared the way for Honduras to receive millions of dollars in U.S. aid two days after the election, certifying that the government has been fighting corruption and upholding human rights, a document seen by Reuters showed. The government was struggling to contain the fallout from the chaos on Monday evening.  Even former TV star Nasralla joined a crowd of boisterous supporters, jumping up and down in a tan suit while flashing peace signs and joining a chant of  the dictatorship will fall,  a video posted on Twitter showed.  The additional powers granted to the army and police including the nighttime curfew from Friday were intended to stem the protests and have led to more than a thousand arrests. Up to 12 people have been killed in the protests or during the curfew. Tens of thousands peacefully took to the streets on Sunday in a show of force for the opposition. The police revolt began when more than 200 members of the Cobras refused to carry on battling protesters, saying it was tantamount to taking sides. Nasralla has repeatedly called on the security forces to ignore orders.  We are rebelling,  said one of the policemen, who covered his face in a ski mask and declined to give his name.  We call on all the police nationally to act with their conscience.  They soon had the support of other units, with reports that their protests had spread to other cities.  The police also said they were angry about the death of two colleagues shot while they were enforcing the curfew on Sunday night, an attack a spokesman said was unrelated to the election protests. Two civilian protesters were killed in the capital overnight, their relatives said, although authorities did not confirm the deaths. The OAS called for peaceful protests, said politicians must not incite violence and that security forces must respect human rights. Last week, at least three people were killed as soldiers broke up protesters  blockades. One police source and local reports said five more had been shot dead in the north of the country on Friday. The deaths have not been confirmed by authorities.  Early last week, Nasralla, a 64-year-old former sportscaster and game show host, appeared set for an upset victory, gaining a five-point lead with more than half of the ballots tallied. The counting process suddenly halted for more than a day and began leaning in favor of Hernandez after resuming.  Opposition leaders on Monday showed a sample of their own records of polling that did not match with the tribunal s. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro accused the United States of backing vote fraud in Honduras, while the U.S. embassy on Monday called for a  transparent, impartial, and opportune election result.  Honduras struggles with violent drug gangs, one of world s highest murder rates and endemic poverty, driving a tide of its people to migrate to the United States.

0,WELFake Dataset,"How does the old saying go? The more unapologetically defensive you appear, the more guilty you probably are   or something like that. That at least seems to be the case with Donald Trump any time he is scrutinized on, well, pretty much anything. However, when it comes to his claim that he s raised money for veterans, even though many are saying he s grossly exaggerating the amount, he really doesn t like being called out on the discrepancy.During a press conference on Tuesday, Trump was asked by ABC s Tom Llamas: Mr. Trump, writing a one million dollar check is incredibly generous, but the night of that Iowa fundraiser you said you had raised $6 million. Clearly you had not. Your critics say you tend to exaggerate, you have a problem with the truth. Is this a prime example? Trump responded: No, I raised almost $6 million. Some of it didn t come through, but more money is coming through. The number is probably is going to be when we finish it probably going to be over the $6 million. Trump then proceeds to blast the media, and then at one point called out Llamas directly, even calling him a  sleaze  for having the audacity to point out facts. Trump said: But what I don t want is when I raise millions of dollars, have people say, like this sleazy guy right over here from ABC. He s a sleaze in my book.

0,WELFake Dataset,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has agreed a financial settlement with Britain, a senior EU official told Reuters on Thursday, under which London has committed to paying a set share of EU budgets after Britain has left the bloc. Following reports of British offers in recent days, EU negotiators have insisted publicly that work is continuing on the financial deal, as both sides also push to reach accords on two other key divorce conditions before a crunch meeting on Monday.  The official offer has not been submitted, but unofficially it has been agreed to such an extent that if no one decides to stage a last minute complete turnaround everything will be OK,  the official said. A spokesperson for Britain s Department for Exiting the European Union was not immediately available for comment.     Overall, the EU side was  optimistic  that agreement could be reached on the conditions to allow EU leaders to agree during a Dec. 14-15 summit to open talks on post-Brexit relations. The British government dismissed as  speculation  on Wednesday reports in British newspapers that it had more than doubled its offer to the EU to very roughly 50 billion euros. The EU official said there was no precise figure discussed because the amounts to be paid in future will depend on many imponderable variables, ranging from whether loan guarantees had to be exercised to the vagaries of the sterling-euro exchange rate and relative growth in the British and EU economies. Britain has committed to meeting an agreed share of the vast bulk of the future budget items which the EU asked for, the official said, adding:  It is a deal on what percentage share Britain will cover and on what items.  The official said the British share would be significantly less than 16 percent - Britain s share last year of the total output of the 28-nation Union. In any case, Britain s economic weight may decline as the pound has sunk since last year s vote to leave the EU, while even in sterling terms, the British economy has been growing more slowly than others.  The share of the economy used for the EU budget is also calculated somewhat differently and Britain has been entitled as a member to a special rebate.  Among key budget lines that Britain has committed to was covering a share of disbursements from the EU budget in years beyond the current seven-year EU budget ending in 2020.  We have agreed a certain formula how to calculate that share. So we take each line in the budget and apply the share to it,  the official said. British Prime Minister Theresa May had said Britain would pay its full share of the budget to the end of 2020 - the point at which the EU expects roughly to end a  transition period , during which Britain will effectively keep all its obligations and most rights in the EU after Brexit in March 2019, while losing its vote on laws. But the EU, which originally estimated the likely  Brexit bill  at roughly 60 billion euros, had demanded Britain also pay its share of items, committed to during that seven-year 2014-2020 budget but not actually disbursed until years later.  All in all, they are ready to pay a suitable, fair price for moving on to the second phase. This is what they want,  the official said of May s push to convince fellow EU leaders to open talks next month on a transition and future trade pact.  They want as soon as possible to solve the transition period issues, because they are afraid companies will start moving,  he added, saying that broadly speaking London was going to be  paying all the EU wanted .

0,WELFake Dataset,"It is getting closer to midnight. On Thursday, the group of scientists who orchestrate the Doomsday Clock, a symbolic instrument informing the public when the earth is facing imminent disaster, moved its minute hand from three to two and a half minutes before the final hour. It was the closest the clock had been to midnight since 1953, the year after the United States and the Soviet Union conducted competing tests of the hydrogen bomb. Though scientists decide on the clock’s position, it is not a scientific instrument, or even a physical one. The movement of its symbolic hands is decided upon by the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The organization introduced the clock on the cover of its June 1947 edition, placing it at seven minutes to midnight. Since then, it has moved closer to midnight and farther away, depending on the board’s conclusions. Thursday’s announcement was made by Rachel Bronson, the executive director and publisher of the bulletin. She was assisted by the theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss, the climate scientist and meteorologist David Titley, and the former United States ambassador Thomas Pickering. Dr. Bronson, in a   interview, explained why the board had included the   mark in the measurement. She said that it was an   signal that was meant to acknowledge “what a dangerous moment we’re in, and how important it is for people to take note. ” “We’re so concerned about the rhetoric, and the lack of respect for expertise, that we moved it 30 seconds,” she said. “Rather than create panic, we’re hoping that this drives action. ” In an   for The New York Times, Dr. Titley and Dr. Krauss elaborated on their concerns, citing the increasing threats of nuclear weapons and climate change, as well as President Trump’s pledges to impede what they see as progress on both fronts, as reasons for moving the clock closer to midnight. “Never before has the Bulletin decided to advance the clock largely because of the statements of a single person,” they wrote. “But when that person is the new president of the United States, his words matter. ” The board has held the responsibility for the clock’s movements since 1973, when the bulletin’s editor, Eugene Rabinowitch, died. Composed of scientists, and nuclear and climate experts, the board meets biannually to discuss where the clock’s hands should fall in light of world events. In the 1950s, the scientists feared nuclear annihilation, and since then, the board has begun to consider other existential threats, including climate change, compromised biosecurity and artificial intelligence. There were crises that the clock was not quick enough to take into account. The Cuban Missile Crisis, for instance, in 1962, did not change the hands of the clock, which at the time stood at seven minutes to midnight. An explanation on the Bulletin’s website accounts for this seeming lapse in timekeeping: “The Cuban Missile Crisis, for all its potential and ultimate destruction, only lasted a few weeks,” it says. “However, the lessons were quickly apparent when the United States and the Soviet Union installed the first hotline between the two capitals to improve communications, and, of course, negotiated the 1963 test ban treaty, ending all atmospheric nuclear testing. ” The end of the Cold War came as a relief to those who had lived in fear of nuclear annihilation for decades, and the minute hand slowly moved away from danger. In 1990, it was at 10 minutes to midnight. The next year, it was a full 17 minutes away, at the relatively undisturbing time of 11:43. “The illusion that tens of thousands of nuclear weapons are a guarantor of national security has been stripped away,” the Bulletin said at the time. But over the next two decades the clock slowly ticked back. Conflict between India and Pakistan, both of whom staged nuclear weapons tests three weeks apart, had the clock at nine minutes to midnight in 1998. By 2007, fears about Iranian and North Korean nuclear capacity had pushed it to 11:55.

The liberal internet sites and some in social media actually believe that the acquittal on all charges brought against the Bundys and five others last week for their peaceful protest and occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon was a sign of white privilege . One outlet, even allowed a black columnist to write that white privilege was now ""weaponized."" 
Consider the moronic claim of Chauncey Devega at Salon , ""Just consider: An all-white jury acquitted militant religious fundamentalists whose avowed aim is hurting the U.S."" 
Excuse me? Hurting the US? How so Mr. Devega? 
Well, according to Mr. Devega, ""Despite the overwhelming evidence against the Bundy militants, on Thursday a federal jury in Portland acquitted them of federal weapons and conspiracy charges. This shocked many observers. It should not have."" 
""Black Americans and other people of color often talk about how there is one legal system for 'them' and another for 'us,'"" he added. 
What is this evidence of which he speaks? Well, he doesn't quite tell us. He never mentions any laws that were broken. It's not against the law to keep and bear arms . It's not against the law to go and occupy an area that is supposed to be under the people's control per the Constitution. Technically, per the Constitution, the land does not belong to the central government. It's not against the law to hold a press conference there. It's not against the law to address your government for grievances. 
In fact, all those things are a part of the law! 
Oh, and what does Mr. Devega have to say about this photo with a black man standing with LaVoy Finicum and Pete Santilli ? 
Does that look like white privilege to you? Did LaVoy Finicum receive white privilege Chauncey? I don't think so. The tyranny you are supporting murdered him in cold blood and now a jury has determined that they were doing nothing wrong that should have warranted their arrest nor his murder. 
How about the months these men sat in jail in Oregon while being denied bail? Was that white privilege? What about the fact they are facing similar trumped up charges in Nevada from something that took place two years ago, and are still sitting in jail? Is that white privilege Chauncey? 
He then went on to ask if Muslims did this would it be terrorism. I can answer that, yes. However, the reason why I can affirm that is because they would have created violence, just as they are taught to do in the Koran as they follow in the footsteps of their founder, Muhammad. They usually do. The only violence at Bundy Ranch or in Oregon was the result of the Oregon State Police , the FBI , and the Bureau of Land Management . Those were the people with guns pointed at citizens, despite Devega's claims otherwise. 
If that was not enough, Devega forgot that a Native American woman, Sheila M. Warren, testified on behalf of… the defense! Was that your white privilege Mr. Devega? 
""As the social-media hashtag #CrimingWhileWhite signals, there is a dual system of justice in the United States of America One exists for white people — especially white conservatives and other members of the right wing — and a separate one for people of color and Muslims,"" added Devega. ""This is white privilege weaponized through the law."" 
Devega is not the only one to put forth this nonsense. 
New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof also claimed this acquittal may have been racially motivated. 
Other people on social media chimed in making the same ridiculous claims without ever once citing any law that was broken.

The 93-year-old former leader who ruled the southern African nation for 37 years, resigned after the army and his ruling ZANU-PF party turned against him when it became clear that his 52-year-old wife, Grace, was being groomed as his successor. Mugabe left Harare with his wife and aides on Monday evening, a Zimbabwe state security official said this week. He was expected to also visit Malaysia where his daughter is expecting a child. An Air Zimbabwe flight arrived in Singapore on Tuesday. Mugabe visited a private hospital in central Singapore on Wednesday with an entourage that included his security guards, the sources who were familiar with the visit told Reuters. They spoke on the condition they were not identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media. A spokesman at the hospital said he would not be able to confirm whether Mugabe had visited its clinics. Mugabe has a reputation for extensive international travel, including regular medical trips to Singapore - a source of public anger among his impoverished citizens.

What the Michigan House actually passed was a garden variety Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which would have exempted religious individuals from laws that infringed on their religious beliefs.Like most state RFRAs, the Michigan bill contained a clause that allows the state to infringe on religious beliefs when there s a  compelling government interest.  The preservation of human life is widely considered to qualify, according to legal experts.The misconception that the bill would allow ambulance drivers to let gay people bleed out in the streets evidently stems from a local CBS story, which was later picked up by CBS News  national website.Huh?

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON/PORTLAND, Me. (Reuters) - Supporters of Republican Donald Trump urged him to get back on message on Thursday after a week of dropping opinion poll numbers and a war of words with ranking Republicans over his U.S. presidential campaign. In response to the criticism, Trump pledged to focus more on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who emerged from last week’s Democratic National Convention with a lead in the polls and who has been consistently attacking him as temperamentally unfit for the presidency. At a rally in Portland, Maine, on Thursday, Trump kept his attention on trying to undermine Clinton’s candidacy. He said the fact that she has moved past a scandal over her use of a private email server as President Barack Obama’s secretary of state was “probably the greatest accomplishment that she has ever had in politics.” Since formally accepting the Republican nomination two weeks ago, Trump has exasperated many supporters by getting bogged down in a public spat with the parents of an American soldier killed in Iraq and some fellow Republicans. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross said he still backed Trump, but urged him to stop engaging in exchanges that benefit the Democrats and make the real estate mogul’s behavior the issue in the campaign. “This election is Donald’s to lose and so far the Democrats have been clever about baiting him and he generally has bitten,” Ross said in an email to Reuters late on Wednesday. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who has endorsed Trump but has not received a reciprocal endorsement from the New York businessman in his re-election bid, told WTAQ radio host Jerry Bader in Green Bay, Wisconsin, that Trump has “had a pretty strange run since the convention.” “You would think we ought to be focusing on Hillary Clinton, on all of her deficiencies. She is such a weak candidate that one would think we’d be on offense against Hillary Clinton, and it is distressing that that’s not what we’re talking about these days,” he said. Michael Caputo, a former Trump adviser who still supports him, said Trump still has time to right the ship. “Staying on message is absolutely key,” Caputo told Reuters. “After 30 years of speaking his mind, Mr. Trump has to understand that the general election for president of the United States is all about staying on message.” Actor and director Clint Eastwood, a prominent celebrity supporter of the Republican Party who appeared at its 2012 U.S. presidential nominating convention, offered an alternative view, saying Trump says some “dumb things” but that Americans should get over it. “He’s onto something because secretly everybody’s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up,” the acclaimed actor and director told Esquire magazine. “That’s the kiss-ass generation we’re in right now.” At the same time, Trump’s lukewarm support for the NATO alliance drew criticism from 37 national security experts from both Democratic and Republican administrations. “We find Trump’s comments to be reckless, dangerous, and extremely unwise,” they wrote in a statement. Obama, at a Pentagon news conference, dismissed Trump’s statements that the election could be “rigged” against him. “Of course, the elections will not be rigged,” he said. Trump’s rough patch has contributed to a dip in support in some battleground states. A WBUR/MassINC poll in New Hampshire showed Clinton leading Trump, 47 percent to 32 percent. Other polls showed Trump down 11 percentage points to Clinton in Pennsylvania and 6 percentage points in Florida, two states that are important to his chances of winning the election. Trump’s troubles are emboldening Democrats to think big. Speaking with reporters after a Clinton campaign event in Las Vegas, U.S. Senator Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, said he believed traditionally Republican-leaning states such as Arizona and Georgia are going to be competitive this election, and he expects Clinton to campaign there. In Portland, some people at Trump’s rally said the candidate should stop getting distracted. “I don’t like how he gets off track,” said Bill Devine, 65, of Bath, Maine. “He needs to stay focused on his campaign.” Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told CBS’s “This Morning” that the campaign is comfortable where it stands now and said the news media have built a false narrative in which Democrats are controlling the race to the Nov. 8 election. Manafort said that Trump’s dropping poll numbers “were expected” and that he expected the numbers to even out soon. “The framework of this election favors Donald Trump. If we run the campaign that we plan on running, we think we’re going to win,” he said.  Concern about Trump has spilled into at least one congressional race. U.S. Representative Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican, has released a campaign ad in his own re-election bid promising to “stand up” to Trump if Trump is elected. “People ask me, ‘What do you think about Trump?’ Honestly, I don’t care for him much. And I certainly don’t trust Hillary,” Coffman said in the ad. U.S. Representative Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican, told MSNBC he could not endorse Trump because of “all these unforced errors” that Trump was making. “It just seems that he’s, at times, hell-bent on losing a very winnable election to a very seriously flawed candidate: Hillary Clinton,” Dent said.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON  —   Thirty years as a union boss in Indiana have given Chuck Jones a thick skin. But even threats to shoot him or burn his house down did not quite prepare him for becoming the target of a verbal takedown by the next president of the United States. In what one Republican strategist described as “cyberbullying,”   Donald J. Trump derided Mr. Jones on Twitter, accusing him of doing “a terrible job representing workers” and blaming him for the decisions by companies that ship American jobs overseas. The Twitter message from the   at 7:41 Wednesday night, and a second one urging Mr. Jones to “spend more time working  —   less time talking,” continued Mr. Trump’s pattern of digital assaults, most of them aimed at his political rivals, reporters, Hollywood celebrities or female accusers. On Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump used Twitter to assail Boeing for escalating costs on the development of a new Air Force One. But rarely has Mr. Trump used Twitter to express his ire at people like Mr. Jones, the president of United Steelworkers Local 1999, who described himself on Thursday as “just a regular working guy. ” With the full power of the presidency just weeks away, Mr. Trump’s decision to single out Mr. Jones for ridicule has drawn condemnation from historians and White House veterans. “When you attack a man for living an ordinary life in an ordinary job, it is bullying,” said Nicolle Wallace, who was communications director for President George W. Bush and a top strategist to other Republicans. “It is cyberbullying. This is a strategy to bully somebody who dissents. That’s what is dark and disturbing. ” Robert Dallek, a presidential historian, called the verbal attack unprecedented and added: “It’s beneath the dignity of the office. He doesn’t seem to understand that. ” Frank Sesno, a former CNN Washington bureau chief and now the director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, said Mr. Trump’s willingness to weaponize his Twitter feed, especially against people who are not political rivals, could produce a chilling effect on people willing to publicly criticize the president. “Anybody who goes on air or goes public and calls out the president has to then live in fear that he is going to seek retribution in the public sphere,” Mr. Sesno said. “That could discourage people from speaking out. ” Wednesday night’s Twitter message from Mr. Trump came after Mr. Jones, on the CNN program “Erin Burnett OutFront,” challenged the  ’s claims. Mr. Jones challenged Mr. Trump’s claim to have saved 1, 100 jobs in Indiana at Carrier Corporation from being shipped overseas and said that 350 of those jobs were already staying in the United States. As Mr. Jones spoke, a graphic flashed across CNN’s screens at 7:20 p. m. referring to something Mr. Jones said earlier in the week: “Carrier Union Boss: Trump Lied His A** Off. ” Less than 20 minutes after Mr. Jones’s interview ended, Mr. Trump’s Twitter message appeared. Mr. Jones said he had just walked back into his house and hung up his coat when he got a call from a friend. “Trump’s hammering you on a tweet,” the friend said, prompting a laugh from Mr. Jones. In the control room at CNN, a planned story on immigration was scrapped, and a booker went scrambling to get Mr. Jones back on the air to respond. Mr. Trump’s message to his 17 million Twitter followers set off threats and other harassing calls to Mr. Jones. One caller left five   messages, and two secretaries answering phones at the local’s headquarters have been similarly swamped. “It’s riled the people up,” Mr. Jones said. “A lot of the people who have called and been not very nice to me, they have been quite clear that they are Trump supporters and I’m an ungrateful   . ” Mr. Jones refused on Thursday to back down from his criticism of Mr. Trump. And he shrugged off Mr. Trump’s claim that he had not done enough to help the workers his union represents. “Hell, I know what I did for the last 30 years,” Mr. Jones said, noting his work on behalf of pensions and salaries that average $23 per hour. But Mr. Jones also said that he and the   have been on the same side when it comes to trying to protect the livelihoods of   workers. He said he would happily collaborate with Mr. Trump to try to save the 550 Carrier jobs still scheduled to be moved to Mexico. “If he in fact called today, and said, ‘Let’s get together to save the 500 jobs,’ I’d be glad to do anything I possibly could to work with him in any fashion,” Mr. Jones said. “I don’t foresee that happening. ” Veterans of the White House say they do not know what to expect from Mr. Trump, whose actions since the election have broken with many presidential norms. David Axelrod, who was a senior adviser to President Obama, said he always advised the current occupant of the Oval Office to be mindful of the extra power that his words carried once they were amplified by the most powerful megaphone in the world. “What you may think is a light tap is a howitzer,” Mr. Axelrod said. “When you have the man in the most powerful office, for whom there is no target too small, that is a chilling prospect. He has the ability to destroy people in 140 characters. ” Throughout the campaign, Mr. Trump dashed off Twitter messages in response to what he saw on television, sometimes calling out specific television personalities like Megyn Kelly or Joe Scarborough by name. Mr. Trump has not stopped since he won the election. When he abruptly took to Twitter on Nov. 29 to attack those who burn the American flag, it happened shortly after a “Fox  Friends” segment about a   incident. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump retweeted several people who were bashing the CNN reporter Jeff Zeleny, and he has been critical of “Saturday Night Live” and the show’s Trump impersonator, Alec Baldwin. Whether Mr. Trump will continue to use Twitter as president is unclear, though few people inside or outside Mr. Trump’s orbit believe he will give up his digital connection to millions of followers. Two spokesmen for Mr. Trump did not respond to emails seeking comment on his Twitter message about Mr. Jones. If he continues to tweet, Mr. Trump may discover that his words carry new weight and are given new meaning when they come from the White House. Ms. Wallace said he may end up having meetings with world leaders that do not go well, and be tempted to tweet his disapproval. “It’s irrevocable what you put out in a tweet. It’s not like you can take it back,” Ms. Wallace said. But she added that she does not expect Mr. Trump to change his behavior once he is inaugurated. “There can be a transformation when you get into the office, but it’s usually on policy, not behavior,” she said. “I’m not sure that the office will change his nature. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

But after the story went viral, the homeless man is now being crowdfunded out of poverty, and that teen is facing the consequences of his actions.65-year-old Ronald Leggatt has been facing the east coast ice storms from a vantage point that most of us couldn t even imagine. While people shiver next to fires in their homes, Leggatt is on the streets, in sub-zero temperatures. Surviving each day is a miracle.On Monday, he was approached by a local teen. He might have hoped for some kind words, or some cash towards extra clothing or food.Instead, the teen offered the desperate man $5 to pour coffee over his own head. So he obliged. 22-year-old local Carlos Mejia posted images of the incident to Facebook, saying: At first I thought it was an act of kindness but I was wrong, The poor man s eyes and face were red because of the burning coffee, In the image, the teen can be seen shaking the hand of a clearly injured Leggatt.After Mejia s post went viral, Lakewood Police investigated the incident and verified that it did take place. But sadly, no charges can be filed against the teen. They said in a statement: After further investigation it was determined, that although the incident occurred in poor judgement, it did not rise to a criminal act, Evidence in the case revealed that both parties were willing participants and no one was injured. But the local community were so outraged by the incident, that they located Ronald Leggatt and decided to provide him with as much assistance as they could muster. First, they got his hair cut, provided him with a decent washroom, and bought him new clothes.They then set up a crowd fund campaign to provide reparations to Leggatt in behalf of the entire community. More than $3,000 has already been raised to help get Laggatt back on his feet.Ari Boyer, a Lakewood resident, told the New York Daily News: The truth is that I saw the thing on Facebook and thought it was a horrible thing to do, I just don t like to see people hurt. Leggatt is almost unrecognizable in his new clothes, clean and trim.But while Laggatt s life has turned around, the teen who abused him in his hour of need has been shamed publicly. So excruciating was the embarrassment, he made a video apology for Ronald Leggatt, offering him $20 and to pour coffee over his own head.Laggatt politely declined the offer.The case is a reminder of the very worst, and the very best, any community of human beings has to offer.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two months after signing it, President Donald Trump has not begun enforcing a law imposing new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea, Senators John McCain and Ben Cardin said in a letter seen by Reuters on Friday. Also, with just two days to go, his administration has not provided information related to Russia’s defense and intelligence sectors required under the measure by Sunday, they said. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment on the letter from McCain, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. Later on Friday, the White House issued a presidential memorandum taking the first step toward implementation by designating different agencies to start the process putting the law into effect. Trump grudgingly signed the “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” on Aug. 2 after Congress overwhelmingly approved the measure despite Trump’s reservations about how it might affect his desire for improved relations with Moscow. The White House had hedged for weeks, as the legislation worked its way through Congress, over whether the president would sign it or use his veto power. Although his fellow Republicans control Congress, it passed both the Senate and House of Representatives by near-unanimous margins large enough to override a veto. Trump’s opposition to the law had raised questions about how enthusiastically his administration would enforce it. “Congress’ swift and united action, and your signature, sent a strong message to our allies and adversaries alike, and particularly to those such as Russia, who have sought to undermine our democracy,” said the letter, dated Thursday. “Now, as critical deadlines are approaching, it is imperative that your Administration implement the law to its fullest extent to uphold and protect American interests,” it said. The law imposed stiff new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea over issues including Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election, which Russia denies, as well as Iran’s ballistic missiles program and North Korea’s nuclear weapons development. The administration in particular opposed a provision that would not let Trump, or any president, ease or lift sanctions on Russia without Congress’ approval. The letter also noted the Oct. 1 deadline for the administration to issue “regulations or other guidance” to identify anyone who is operating on behalf of the Russian defense and intelligence sectors for potential sanctions.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates hardened their  positions on Sunday on blocking a move by President Barack Obama to fill the Supreme Court seat left by the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, a lifetime appointment that would help decide some of the most divisive issues facing Americans.  The next justice could tilt the balance of the nation’s highest court, which was left with four conservatives and four liberals. The vacancy quickly became an issue in the 2016 presidential race. “We ought to make the 2016 election a referendum on the Supreme Court,” U.S. Senator and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” The normally nine-justice court is set to decide this year its first major abortion case in nearly a decade, as well as cases on voting rights, affirmative action and immigration. Scalia, 79, died on Saturday at a West Texas resort. The cause of death will not be determined for several days, the top official in the county where he died, Presidio County Judge Cinderela Gueara, said on Sunday in an interview with local TV station WFAA-TV. Obama, a Democrat, will nominate someone to fill the empty seat but will wait until the U.S. Senate is back in session, the White House said on Sunday. The Senate returns from recess on Feb. 22. “At that point, we expect the Senate to consider that nominee, consistent with their responsibilities laid out in the United States Constitution,” White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. The White House declined to give a more specific timeline for Obama to announce his nominee. The nomination will set up a battle with the Republican-controlled chamber, which must approve any nominee. Shortly after news of Scalia’s death, Republicans vowed not to act on the vacancy until Obama’s successor takes office next January. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said failure to act would be a “shameful abdication” of the Senate’s constitutional duty. Both sides said history was on their side.  Reid said it would be unprecedented to have a vacancy on the court for a year. In the modern era, the longest Supreme Court vacancy was 363 days after Abe Fortas resigned in May 1969.  Republicans cited 80 years of tradition in which no Supreme Court nominees were approved in presidential election years. In fact, Justice Anthony Kennedy was approved in 1988, after a bruising battle in which the Senate rejected President Ronald Reagan’s first nominee, conservative Robert Bork. Supreme Court nominations are rare, so neither side has much data to rely on in determining precedents. History is also an unreliable guide as the nomination process has become significantly more politicized in recent years. For Obama’s previous two Supreme Court picks, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, he took about 30 days each to announce the elections after their predecessors, Justice John Paul Stevens and Justice David Souter, respectively, said they planned to step down. Ohio Governor John Kasich, a moderate among the Republicans vying for the White House, said the Senate should wait because a battle this year would only deepen divisions in the country. “You know how polarized everything is,” Kasich said on ABC’s “This Week.” “What I don’t want to see is more fighting and more recrimination.” Democratic U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy warned that a delay could have consequences in November’s election, when voters get to decide who fills one-third of the Senate’s seats. “If the Republican leadership refuses to even hold a hearing, I think that is going to guarantee they lose control of the Senate, because I don’t think the American people will stand for that,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”    Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said the Constitution was clear. “The president makes the appointment, Senate confirms, let’s get on with that business,” the senator from Vermont said on “Fox News Sunday.” One possible contender to replace Scalia is an Indian-American appeals court judge, Sri Srinivasan, who has pro-business credentials and a stellar resume. His nomination could make it more politically challenging for Republicans to block anyone put forward by Obama. Cruz, a Texas lawmaker, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee that takes the lead on Supreme Court nominees, said the vacancy left by Scalia made the presidential election even more critical. He warned that a justice chosen by Sanders or his Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, would mean the Second Amendment right to bear arms would be “written out” of the Constitution and abortion on demand would become the law of the land.  Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another White House candidate, said he would want someone who echoed Scalia’s “originalist” ideology that looks at the U.S. Constitution through the lens of its framers’ 18th-century intentions. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, appearing on NBC, was more direct when asked what he would want: “Someone just like Justice Scalia.” That would mean someone who did not let ideological differences preclude civility or even friendship, former President Bill Clinton told CNN, citing Scalia’s bond with liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Ginsburg, in a statement on Sunday, called her friend “a jurist of captivating brilliance and wit” with whom she disagreed “now and then.” She cited a duet sung by the two justices in the 2015 opera “Scalia/Ginsburg” titled: “We are different, we are one.” She and Scalia, Ginsburg wrote, were “different in our interpretation of written texts, one in our reverence for the Constitution and the institution we serve.”  (Additional reporting by Joan Biskupic, Alana Wise, Timothy Gardner in Washington; Sara Vasquez in Marfa, Texas; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney) SAP is the sponsor of this content.

NFL players have joined the now unemployed 49 ers QB Colin Kaepernick to take a knee on the field during our national anthem as a way to show support for the Black Lives Matter anti-cop movement. The protest exploded over the weekend when President Trump spoke out against the disrespect NFL players are showing for our flag, turning the protest into an anti-Trump protest for players who many believe are still angry that Trump won the election, defeating the seriously flawed Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton.Ford Motor Co., Armour Inc., and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA issued statements that affirmed NFL players  rights to kneel during the pre-game national anthem, while also sounding patriotic notes and affirming their support for the flag.Ford Motor Co, one of the biggest sponsors of the NFL just revealed that they are supporting the national anthem protests.

[During a meeting of Native American tribal leaders, the Tohono O’odham Nation’s Vice Chairman Verlon Jose threatened protests similar to those known as ‘Standing Rock,’ where environmentalists protested the Dakota Access Pipeline, if Trump’s wall is built, according to AZ Central:  Before the day was over and the guests left the remote desert mission on tribal lands, Jose would bash Trump’s proposed wall, calling it a waste of taxpayer dollars and comparing it to the Berlin Wall. He would call on people to see the barrier as an international   issue, offer an alternative plan for tightening border security, and acknowledge that innocent tribal members are subjected to increased vehicle searches by Border Patrol agents. He also warned of a mass protest on the border if diplomacy fails to keep the U. S. government off Tohono O’odham land, a protest that he said would rival Standing Rock. Jose is threatening the protests because his tribe sits on more than 2 million acres across a southern Arizona desert that crosses through Mexico, across the U. S.  Border. Besides gathering to threaten a protest against the construction of the border wall, the meeting of tribal leaders also included a chant demanding a “sanctuary for all. ” “They chanted a message printed on   for the trek: No Deportations, No Ban, No Wall, Sanctuary for All,” the AZ Central noted.

0,WELFake Dataset,"(Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers has introduced a bill that would ban agreements to keep sexual harassment and discrimination claims out of court, amid a wave of sexual misconduct allegations against powerful men.  Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives unveiled the bill on Wednesday, saying mandatory arbitration agreements had forced women to privately arbitrate misconduct claims, effectively silencing victims and enabling serial harassers.  An arbitration case is similar to a lawsuit, but the proceedings are typically confidential.  Dozens of prominent American men in politics, media and entertainment have been accused in recent months of sexual harassment and misconduct. In some of those cases, their accusers had been required to sign agreements with their employers to keep work-related legal claims in arbitration. The bill would make those agreements unenforceable in sexual harassment and discrimination cases brought under federal law.  Lawmakers said an estimated 60 million U.S. workers have mandatory arbitration agreements. The issue of sexual harassment was in focus in Washington on Thursday as Senator Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota, announced he would step down after several women accused him of unwanted touching. Franken has denied some of the claims and apologized to other accusers.  On Tuesday, Representative John Conyers, a Democrat from Michigan, resigned after allegations that he sexually harassed staffers. Conyers, who was the longest-serving member of Congress, has denied the claims. Business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Federation of Independent Business have said in the past that arbitration can benefit both employers and workers who want to keep their claims confidential.  The bill is sponsored in the Senate by Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Kamala Harris of California, and Republicans Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. It also has two sponsors from each party in the House.  The lawmakers were joined at a news conference in Washington by former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson, who sued former network chief Roger Ailes for harassment last year. The claims led to Ailes’ resignation and a $20 million settlement for Carlson. Ailes and Fox denied any wrongdoing.  Carlson said arbitration agreements like the one she signed with Fox allow harassers to stay in their jobs, even when victims are pushed out or fired. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"(Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill on Thursday to repeal major parts of Obamacare and replace it with a Republican healthcare plan, handing President Donald Trump his biggest legislative victory but setting up a tough fight in the Senate. STEPHEN WOOD, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS, NEW YORK: “This strikes to me that the market is breathing a sigh of relief more than a nod of approval. I think there will be progress on individual and corporate tax cuts but they will come at the end of 2017. This will be positive for the economy and markets. We think there will be ‘knots in the floss’ to get legislation done. We expect to see more sloppiness in the legislative process so you have to focus on fundamentals.

Europe is increasingly interesting from an equity perspective. One would be more comfortable with Europe compared with the U.S.” “Elections have consequences, and I think that this is the very first manifestation of it. It would be foolish to say that it doesn’t reinvigorate Trump because ... earlier this week the main headlines were that the budget was an Obama-type budget instead of anything that was promised during the campaign. “Once Republicans develop cohesion you are going to see more of a domino effect. It’s like, ‘We all got onboard with this (healthcare reform), what’s stopping us from trying to get money for the wall or having tax reform that’s going to be agreeable to the president’s agenda?’ So I think that it does in some way invigorate it.”  GUY LEBAS, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT, PHILADELPHIA: “What is a bit lost in the perception that House’s healthcare reform bill is positive for financial markets is a proposed repeal of a surcharge of roughly 3.9 percent on investment income on high-income individuals, which is in the Affordable Care Act. Now this bill goes to the Senate. For the market, the odds of passage of at least this version of ‘repeal-and-replace’ in the Senate isn’t very high. It’s going to a tough sell in the Senate. This is largely a non-event for the bond market. It’s more gearing up for tomorrow’s jobs report and what Yellen might say.” RANDY FREDERICK, VICE PRESIDENT, TRADING AND DERIVATIVES, CHARLES SCHWAB, AUSTIN, TEXAS: “I think anything that they (Republicans) get done, that they accomplish, popular or unpopular, will show that they have the ability to make progress and to get things done and work together. Because obviously the biggest divisions are not between the Democrats and the Republicans but within the Republican party. “This puts the idea of tax reform a little bit closer to reality, simply because it’s shown that they have figured out a way to negotiate and work together.” JOSEPH KRIST, PARTNER, CREDIT SPECIALIST, COURT STREET GROUP RESEARCH, NEW YORK:     “It means that it satisfies those members of Congress who have made this a primary campaign issue and want to say they want to repeal Obamacare and we voted to did it. From a policy standpoint it is virtually meaningless. The bill from everything I have seen is virtually impossible to pass in the Senate.”     “I don’t think this really should have any impact. The fundamentals driving people’s healthcare ideas came before the election. People looking at small standalone and rural hospitals, saw they were wall badly positioned for healthcare reform going forward, whether it be because of Obamacare, should it remain, due to cost reduction measures. And conversely people were looking at size as a really important factor, whether a large institution or large chains. The consolidation was already coming whether repealed or not. It is not really a big factor from a public finance fixed income perspective. You still want big balance sheets, large pools of cash and diversity revenues.”  “This morning going in the market was expecting the House was going to pass it and it did.” “This is just one of several different things Trump is trying to get accomplished. This is out of the way and now they have to go to tax reform. That’s something that’s going to drag out for a while and probably the next key thing, aside from the geopolitical things that are going on.”      “As far as traders and investors I talk to, this (healthcare bill) isn’t affecting their position or what they want to do.”  RICK MECKLER, PRESIDENT, LIBERTYVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: “The fact that they could pass this doesn’t make much of a difference. The real risk in the near term to the so-called Trump rally was a failure to pass it. “I don’t know if this market is really that focused on healthcare as the big issue. I think they’re really focused on the tax plan. If they couldn’t pass the healthcare, it would bode very poorly for the tax plan.  “But the fact that they could pass the healthcare, even pass it in the House, and pass it so narrowly, I don’t think it necessarily means the tax plan is more likely to come through.” KEN POLCARI, DIRECTOR OF THE NYSE FLOOR DIVISION, O’NEIL SECURITIES, NEW YORK: “It passes the House, that’s fine, now it goes to the Senate, and we know in the Senate it is going to have a very tough time. So even though it has passed the one, it is certainly not a done deal yet. Obamacare is still very much alive and intact.  “The market has really been flat. I don’t necessarily think this is such a surprise, after all the news reports today and yesterday, people were expecting it. They are all high-fiving and cheering and all that stuff in the Congress but it still has to go to the Senate and that is where it is going to run into some problems.  “The market is again biding time, there is no reason it’s not really taking off, we are hitting our head at the ceiling, we have been hitting our head on the ceiling. If anything it is going to cause it, the catalyst is going to be the (French election) Sunday night.

DOCTORS studying the make-up of young fellas have found that they are made of nothing these days, in contrast to the men of old. 
The scientific study, carried out by a team of genetic experts at Trinity College Dublin, found that the majority of Irish males aged between 16-30 have grown a lot weaker physically and less resilient to cold temperatures over the past 60 years. Of 100 Irish males tested in physical work environments, 67% percent moaned about being tired and fatigued after just two minutes. 
“We put the study group to work on a local farm picking spuds, weeding gardens and doing general old time shit,” lead researcher Professor Conor Tracey explains, “We even made them travel to work in their bare feet. The results we got back were absolutely appalling to tell you the truth. Only a small minority of the men got on with their chores without complaining”. 
In fact, further testing found that 89% of those studied were ‘perishers’, a trait increasing in modern day males. 
“Nearly every one of them began whinging about the cold during the picking stones in the frost task,” Dr. Tracey added, “They began complaining that their ikkle fingies were sore, and that they couldn’t feel their hands or feet from the cold. Poor pets. Several lads even tried to pretend they were sick in a bid to get out of the job, and one 18-year-old subject began crying for his mammy like a big baby, so he did”. 
The study concluded that 92% of Irish men were found to be made of nothing these days, compared to the young fellas of years ago who used to walk to school in their bare feet, before then going to work in the mines for 18 hours a day.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Top university stole millions from taxpayers by faking global warming research 
  J. D. Heyes (NaturalNews) The 'global warming/climate change' charade is bad enough in that it is nothing more than a politically motivated ""issue"" used by globalists of all political stripes to gain more control over the world's population.But now it's costing some citizens scarce tax dollars.As reported by The Daily Caller , a top university in Britain has been caught stealing millions of taxpayer dollars from a federal budget that is chronically in the red just to produce phony global warming data .A global warming research center at the London School of Economics received millions of dollars (pounds) from UK taxpayers after taking credit for research it did not perform.The UK's Daily Mail noted further that the UK government provided £9 million ($11 million in US dollars) in funding to the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP) in exchange for research that was never done. Massive scientific fraud regarding 'global warming' A number of papers that CCCEP claimed to have published to receive government funding were not even about global warming and were written before the organization was even founded, or written by researchers who were not affiliated with the center. Worse, government officials never bothered to check CCCEP's alleged publication lists, saying instead they were ""taken on trust,"" according to a recently released report.""It is serious misconduct to claim credit for a paper you haven't supported, and it's fraud to use that in a bid to renew a grant,"" Professor Richard Tol, a climate economics expert from Sussex University whose research was reportedly stolen by CCCEP, told the Daily Mail . ""I've never come across anything like it before. It stinks.""The center's chairman since 2008 has been Nick Stern, a well-known global advocate for more policy action supposedly aimed at combating climate change. In addition he is also the president of the British Academy, an invitation-only society that is reserved for the academic elite and which disburses grant money in the millions of pounds to researchers, as well as Lord Stern's own organization.In recent days the CCCEP, which is jointly based at the London School of Economics and the University of Leeds, hosted a gala event that was attended by experts and officials from around the world. The occasion: A celebration to mark the 10th anniversary of the Stern Review, a 700-page report detailing the alleged economic impact of climate change, a review that was commissioned by Tony Blair's government.The massive paper claimed that the world must take immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or face dramatically higher costs in the future. The review exerted a great amount of power and influence on a series of British governments, as well as international organizations.But now the report's contents and conclusions are in serious doubt. Not the first time global warming data has been FAKED Following the Daily Mail 's report, CCCEP spokesman Bob Ward admitted the organization had ""made mistakes,"" in both claiming credit for studies it did not perform and foro papers that were actually researched and published by other academics.Academics and experts whose work was falsely represented were furious, including one who said CCCEP's actions were ""a clear case of fraud – using deception for financial gain,"" The DC reported.Studies receiving financial support from the public sector are not required to disclose it as an ethical conflict of interest, even when financial support is in the millions of dollars. The DC noted that recent studies in the United States, which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses to support the 'scientific' case for its massive new power plant regulations, the Clean Power Plan, saw the agency give $32.1 million, $9.5 million, and $3.65 million in public funds to lead authors – all of whom essentially provided the agency with the 'results' it wanted.As Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, reported in June 2014 , this isn't the first time so-called global warming/climate change data has been faked.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Donald Trump hasn t even been sworn in yet and he s already beating Richard Nixon when it comes to being a liar.Forty-four years have passed since the Watergate scandal dominated the news. Carl Bernstein was one of the Washington Post reporters who broke the scandal wide open.Throughout his presidency, Richard Nixon repeatedly lied and misled people. And when Watergate happened, he tried to cover it up by any means necessary. In the end, Nixon was forced to resign because he was going to be impeached. He remains the only president who has ever resigned the office and the Watergate scandal became the scandal by which other political scandals are judged.Well, Donald Trump has spent the last few days defending Russia and desperately trying to cover up the fact that Russia hacked into our election to help Trump win. He doesn t believe the CIA assessment concluding that Russia interfered and claimed on Fox News Sunday that Democrats are pushing a lie to taint his  great victory. In short, Trump threw American intelligence agencies under the bus to defend Putin and accused Democrats of making up a scandal. This is something that Richard Nixon would do. But unlike Trump, Nixon didn t deny facts at every turn, nor did he lie every time he spoke.Trump does exactly that on Twitter every day, launching attacks and smear campaigns against anyone who criticizes him or runs a story he doesn t like. Trump also exaggerates his supposed accomplishments like the Carrier deal, which is nothing more than a windfall for Carrier at taxpayer expense while jobs are slashed anyway.Carl Bernstein knows this first-hand, which is why he declared Trump a bigger liar than Nixon during an appearance on CNN. Trump lives and thrives in a fact-free environment,  Bernstein said.  No president, including Richard Nixon, has been so ignorant of fact and disdains fact in the way that this president-elect does. And it has something to do with the growing sense of authoritarianism that he and his presidency are projecting and the danger of it is obvious and he s trying to make the conduct of the press the issue, not his own conduct. Bernstein used Trump s Carrier deal as an example of his lies and Trump s attack against a steelworkers union leader as an example of Trump denying facts and lashing out at anyone who dares to call him out. He doesn t go to a fact-based argument, he goes to an emotion-base argument,  Bernstein pointed out.  What we have seen throughout the campaign is pathological disdain for the truth. Jeffrey Lord, of course, whined about Bernstein s analysis, but Berstein stood by what he said and doubled down. We now have a president-elect who, in terms of truthfulness Richard Nixon was nothing, in terms of lying, compared to what we have seen from Donald Trump. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump is more unfit to be president than Richard Nixon. We could very well be looking at the most scandal-ridden administration in American history and it hasn t even taken over yet.

0,WELFake Dataset,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German industry leaders want a shift toward digital services to be a priority as the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) appear set to enter coalition talks with Angela Merkel s conservatives and the Greens. The FDP, which returned from the German political wilderness with 10.7 percent of the vote in Sunday s election, promise to cut taxes and raise investment in infrastructure, partly funded by privatizations. Investing in high-speed telecoms networks and automation would boost economic activity and global competitiveness and has long been a key demand of Germany s export-led manufacturers   although some workers fear it risks job losses.  Investments in education and digital infrastructure are urgently needed,  Werner Baumann, chief executive of drugmaker Bayer (BAYGn.DE), said in an emailed statement. Joe Kaeser, chief executive of industrial group Siemens (SIEGn.DE) agreed, but warned of marginalizing workers and pushing them into the arms of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), the first far-right party to enter the German parliament in more than half a century.  We are an industrial nation and must shape the fourth industrial revolution and design it in a socially inclusive way - so that as many people profit from its as possible,  he said. Economists see such investments as a way to combat the effects of an ageing population and to boost stalling productivity gains, factors that are casting a shadow over growth prospects in the medium term in Europe s largest economy.  Domestically, a focus on digitalisation is one opportunity to counteract these structural headwinds, and re-accelerate productivity growth,  Morgan Stanley economist Elga Bartsch wrote in a note. German business confidence deteriorated unexpectedly in the weeks before Sunday s federal election, suggesting that a consumption-led upswing could lose momentum in coming months. Thilo Brodtmann, executive director of powerful engineering lobby VDMA, said on Monday:  We need a clear signal for a digital breakthrough, for education and research, innovation-friendly tax policies and above all a priority for flexibility and good ideas.  The VDMA represents large manufacturers such as engineering group Siemens, robot maker Kuka (KU2G.DE) or machine-tool maker DMG Mori (GILG.DE) as well as a host of smaller firms banking on digitization to boost productivity. And a host of communications firms including Vodafone (VOD.L), Liberty Global (LBTYA.O) and United Internet (UTDI.DE) stand ready to take advantage of funds that may be made available to expand rural broadband, for example through the further privatization of incumbent Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE).  But UBS economist Felix Huefner said he doubted that any radical stimulus measures would be taken soon, given that the German economy is expected to grow at its strongest pace in six years this year.  Even if digitalization may be a key priority for Merkel, we don t expect deep reforms... given the lack of pressure in a very benign economic environment,  he wrote in a note.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and his wife, Jane Sanders have hired prominent defense attorneys, amid an FBI investigation into a loan Jane Sanders obtained to expand Burlington College while she was its president, CBS News confirms.Politico Magazine first reported the Sanders had hired lawyers to defend them in the probe. Sanders top adviser Jeff Weaver told CBS News the couple has sought legal protection over federal agents  allegations from a January 2016 complaint accusing then-President of Burlington College, Ms. Sanders, of distorting donor levels in a 2010 loan application for $10 million from People s United Bank to purchase 33 acres of land for the institution.According to Politico, prosecutors might also be looking into allegations that Sen. Sanders  office inappropriately urged the bank to approve the loan.Heat Street  When Jane O Meara Sanders served as president of Burlington College between 2004 and 2011, she oversaw an aggressive effort to enroll more students and expand the campus to accommodate a bigger student body. Part of that plan: Taking out hefty loans to finance the $10 million purchase of 32 acres of prime property from the Roman Catholic diocese at the end of 2010.But Burlington College soon found itself unable to make its loan payments. The Roman Catholic diocese, which had sold off the land to help pay for a $17 million sexual-abuse settlement, ultimately lost between $1.5 million and $2 million, according to the letter calling for investigation, as well as several Vermont media outlets. The diocese did not respond to a request for an interview. But a source with direct knowledge of the diocese s involvement in the land acquisition says Burlington College almost immediately struggled to meet its obligations. It was within a relatively short time after closing [the deal], they were experiencing financial problems that made it impossible to pay the diocese,  the source says, adding that Burlington soon went into default mode on its loan.Parishioners now say that to secure loans to buy the land, Ms. Sanders misrepresented the amount that had been pledged to the college in its fundraising push.The request for investigation notes that defrauding a bank is a federal crime; it s punishable by up to 30 years in prison and $1 million in fines, according to federal code. Watch Sanders rail against inequality and corruption at his commencement speech to the 2017 graduating class at Brooklyn College: Ms. Sanders  push for the liberal arts college s costly land acquisition was cited in a press release by the college when it shut down in 2016. And as for the claim that Ms. Sanders manipulated the loan application, Weaver  said,  The loan was approved by the financial board at the college. Sen. Sanders, formerly mayor of Burlington, Vermont s largest city, regards the claims as a political game levied against him after his run for president in the 2016 primary election, a platform which has transformed the small-state senator into an influential voice in American liberal politics.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Generic drug prices have nearly quadrupled in the past five years — and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has a plan to fix it.

On Monday, Sanders, who is also running for the Democratic presidential nomination, rolled out a proposal that would place strict limits on how quickly pharmaceutical companies could hike generic drug prices. Specifically, drug manufacturers would have to pay a rebate back to Medicaid if their drug prices grew faster than inflation. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) is introducing the same bill in the House.

Generic drugs are cheaper versions of drugs that have lost their patent. But in recent years, the prices for generic drugs have been rising quickly and inexplicably. One report from pharmacy benefits manager Catamaran found that consumers paid, on average, $13.14 for each prescription of the 50 most popular generics in 2010. By 2014, they paid $62.10 — a 373 percent increase.

Sanders has previously cited federal records at hearings, showing that the prices of more than 1,200 generic medications rose an average of 448 percent between July 2013 and July 2014.

Generic drugs are typically meant to make medicine cheaper, giving patients less-expensive access to the costly drug formulations that pharmaceutical companies develop. You can see this clearly in the over-the-counter market: you can get 100 generic ibuprofen pills for $7.49 — or pay $9.99 for the brand-name drug Advil.

Generic drugs now compose more than 80 percent of all prescriptions dispensed annually in the United States, and experts think that's helped slow the growth of overall drug spending.

In recent years though, the market for generic prescription medications has become increasingly expensive, with drug manufacturers hiking up generic prices. This seems especially likely to happen when there is just one drug company making the generic, giving that manufacturer pretty complete control over the prices it wants to charge.

Consider the case of albendazole, an antiparasite drug that helps kill an infection caused by worms. It's not an especially common drug because it treats a relatively uncommon problem among lower-income populations, particularly refugees and immigrants.

Albendazole's patents expired years ago but there's still only one company that makes it, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). And recently the drugmaker has quietly hiked the price. Data published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that the average cost Medicaid paid for an albendazole prescription has increased from $36.10 in 2008 to $241.30 in 2013.

This is the exact same drug; the only difference is that in the span of six years, its price tag rose six-fold.

And albendazole isn't alone — there is a lot of data showing a steep increase in generic drug prices. The National Community Pharmacist Association says its members have seen generic prices increase ""as much as 600 percent"" in recent years.

The United States is one of the only developed countries that do not negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies.

In Spain, the United Kingdom, and pretty much all other European countries, the government sits down with drugmakers and haggles over how much it will pay. Each country uses different negotiating tactics. The United Kingdom, for example, runs its bargaining through the National Institute for Clinical Evaluation, typically known by its acronym, NICE.

The United States works differently. Federal law bars Medicare, the country's largest insurance plan, from negotiating with drugmakers. Once a pharmaceutical company sets its price, the government-run plan that insures 49 million seniors is required to accept it.

There are thousands of private insurers, though, and they often have little clout to demand lower prices. Other countries are essentially buying in bulk, like shopping at Costco. The United States does the equivalent of going to the local grocery store — and paying more.

""We don't have a NICE in the United States,"" said Steven Pearson, founder and president of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Reviews, a nonprofit that evaluates evidence on medical tests. ""We have a system that says, ‘If it's better, we have to provide this pill, and you, the drugmaker, get to name the price.' It's not a market. It's drugmakers saying what they want.""

Sanders's new proposal wouldn't give the government the power to negotiate drug prices (although that is also an idea the Vermont senator supports).

Instead, it would require generic drug manufacturers to give Medicaid, the program that covers low-income Americans, a rebate for any growth in drug prices above and beyond overall inflation.

Drug companies will almost certainly oppose this idea, as it would cut into their profits — and, they'll argue, into their development of generic drugs. Sometimes they will cite a shortage of raw materials as a reason for the price hikes, and would likely point to that as reasons why they couldn't produce the drugs for less. Pharma is a strong lobby, and that (along with overall gridlock in Congress) would be a significant obstacle for this type of bill.

Still, the idea of rebates is not unprecedented in American health policy. Federal law requires that Medicaid get a 23 percent discount on all brand-name drugs' sticker prices. And individual state Medicaid programs are allowed to negotiate even lower prices with drugmakers if they so choose. The idea there was similar to the one in the Sanders bill: making drug prices cheaper for the program that serves the lowest-income Americans.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"(CNN) French police say two suspects in Wednesday's terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine are still on the loose after escaping onto the streets of Paris.

In a statement on their website, French national police ask for information on the whereabouts of suspects Cherif Kouachi and Said Kouachi, warning that both could be armed and dangerous.

Police released photos of the two men, who Paris Deputy Mayor Patrick Klugman told CNN are brothers in their 30s.

Cherif Kouachi, left, and Said Kouachi, right, are suspects in the Paris attack.

Police found an ID document of Said Kouachi at the scene of the shooting, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. ""It was their only mistake,"" said Dominique Rizet, BFMTV's police and justice consultant, reporting that the discovery helped the investigation.

Citing sources, the Agence France Presse news agency reported that an 18-year-old suspect in the attack had surrendered to police. CNN has not independently confirmed whether the suspect has surrendered.

Police fanned out across France in an intense manhunt for the suspects, who were masked and dressed in black when they burst into the satirical magazine's office Wednesday, killing 12 people.

A tactical unit was deployed in an operation about a 144 kilometers (about 90 miles) from Paris in Reims, France, following the attack, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. Authorities haven't revealed details about the target of the operation, but speculation surged in French media that investigators could be closing in on the suspects.

French authorities vowed to step up security and apprehend those responsible.

""Everything will be done to arrest (the attackers),"" French President Francois Hollande said in a speech Wednesday night. ""... We also have to protect all public places. Security forces will be deployed everywhere there can be the beginning"" of a threat.

It's too soon to say whether the suspects were operating alone, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said.

The gunmen said they were avenging the Prophet Mohammed and shouted ""Allahu akbar,"" which translates to ""God is great,"" Molins said.

A witness who works in the office opposite the magazine's told BFMTV that he saw two hooded men, dressed in black, enter the building heavily armed.

""We then heard them open fire inside, with many shots,"" he said. ""We were all evacuated to the roof. After several minutes, the men fled, after having continued firing in the middle of the street.""

The men reportedly spoke fluent French with no accent.

One unsettling video, posted to YouTube, shows two men shooting on a Paris street, then walking up to and firing point-blank at a seemingly wounded man as he lay on the ground.

Video shows a gunman approaching his getaway car and raising his finger in the air in what appears to be a signal, possibly to another vehicle or other people who might have played a role in the attack, a Western intelligence source briefed on the French investigation told CNN.

'Parisians will not be afraid'

At an event in Paris' Place de la Republique, demonstrators held up pens in honor of the slain cartoonists and chanted, ""We are Charlie!"" Pictures posted online showed similar demonstrations in other cities, including Rome, Berlin and Barcelona.

""Parisians will not be afraid,"" Klugman said. ""We will fight terrorism with our common values, freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of the press. ... We are at war, but we still want to behave as a leading democracy.""

Armed soldiers could be seen standing guard outside monuments, in transit stations and elsewhere in well-trafficked spots around France by Wednesday evening.

Police impounded a black Citroen in northeastern Paris similar to the one purportedly used by the attackers as a getaway car. Video from CNN affiliate BFMTV shows the vehicle being towed from Porte de Pantin, in Paris' 19th district.

Investigators will do a complete DNA work-up on the Citroen, including soil signatures that might suggest where the gunmen came from, a Western intelligence source briefed on the probe told CNN.

The same source said that French authorities are searching all travel records from the past 17 days to see whether any of the attackers entered the European nation over the holidays. This includes checks at Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, as well as whatever limited information is available from train stations.

Thursday will be a national day of mourning for those killed in the attack, Hollande said. He asked for a moment of reflection Thursday and said flags will be at half-staff for three days.

Its last tweet before Wednesday's attack featured a cartoon of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Earlier cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed spurred protests and the burning of the magazine's office three years ago.

A year later, in an interview with Le Monde newspaper, Charbonnier gave little indication that he planned to change Charlie Hebdo's ways.

""It may sound pompous,"" he said, ""but I'd rather die standing than live on my knees.""

Of course, you care. And I love you for it. This is the day we like to cook without a recipe. A day sans receta, as El Bloombito would say if he were a cook. A recent meal built from fresh field peas, marinated cucumbers and tomatoes, plus an impromptu snack of radishes that spent a couple of hours in red wine vinegar, cayenne and salt, got me thinking about why vinegar is really an unsung savior as summer produce plays out. You can combine it with olive oil and garlic to marinate a pork tenderloin or chicken breasts, which gets you into Sam Sifton’s spiedie territory. It can dress any number of leftover steamed vegetables (or try   a technique J. Kenji   discussed on “The Splendid Table”). Or you could do what Nina Bernstein, a New York Times investigative reporter, does when she is not unearthing the sad things that happen to cadavers in New York. She learned the technique from her mother, and she uses it almost daily for her salad. Mash garlic and kosher salt together in a wooden bowl, add a dollop of Dijon mustard and a splash or two of vinegar (she uses balsamic). Stirring steadily and rapidly, slowly pour in a thin stream of   olive oil. Adjust the salt and acid. Pile some dry, sturdy lettuce into the bowl. You can keep it in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve. Then toss it all together. “Tossing well is crucial,” she said. “When you think it’s well tossed, toss some more. ” That salad would be great with a bowl of steamed mussels from David Tanis, or steamed clams à la Sifton, or a   piece of   fish from the steady hand of Martha Rose Shulman. Sometimes you just need a bowl of pasta. Mark Bittman has a good puttanesca, which you can probably make from the pantry.

0,WELFake Dataset,"If Donald J. Trump’s first news conference as   was a raucous, chaotic affair on Wednesday  —   and it was  —   the parody of it on “Saturday Night Live” was somehow calmer and more organized than the actual event. Still, the “S. N. L. ” sketch pulled few punches as it swung at the show’s most powerful, persistent critic, mocking Mr. Trump on a range of subjects, including the perceived lack of star power at his coming inauguration his opaque plan to divest himself from his businesses and the possibility that Russia possessed unverified compromising information on him. Saturday night’s episode, the first new one of 2017, once again featured Alec Baldwin as Mr. Trump. He started off the faux news conference by vowing to answer what he said was “the question that’s on everyone’s mind. ” “Yes, this is real life,” he said. “This is really happening. On January 20, I, Donald J. Trump, will become the 45th president of the United States. ” He continued: “And then, two months later, Mike Pence will become the 46th. ” Listing the performers who are scheduled for his inauguration, he cited the rock band 3 Doors Down, “Jackie What’  ” from “America’s Got Talent” and “the one Rockette with the least money in her savings. ” (He also said the actors Angelina Jolie, Ryan Gosling and Jennifer Lawrence would be in attendance “courtesy of Madame Tussauds. ”) Turning to questions from reporters played by the “S. N. L. ” cast, Mr.    pointedly refused to answer questions about an alleged compromising videotape, because, he said, “it didn’t happen and it wasn’t as cool as it sounded. ” Asked by a reporter played by Sasheer Zamata how he planned to repeal and replace Obamacare, Mr. Baldwin said, “I actually do have a replacement plan, O. K.? I just read about it this week. It’s a terrific plan. Just great. It’s called the Affordable Care Act. ” When Ms. Zamata’s character said that repealing Obamacare meant that people could die, Mr. Baldwin replied, “Listen, sweetheart, I’m about to be president, we’re all going to die. ” As the   Mr. Baldwin went on to say that he was turning his companies over to his sons, “Beavis and  . ” (“You can tell they’re good businessmen because of how   their hair is,” he said.) Recreating another scene from the news conference, the “S. N. L. ” cast member Cecily Strong appeared as Sheri A. Dillon, a tax lawyer for Mr. Trump who spoke at the actual news conference. In a low monotone, Ms. Strong motioned toward a large pile of   papers in various folders that she said proved Mr. Trump was divesting from his companies. “If he wasn’t divesting, how could there be so many damn papers?” she said. The “S. N. L. ” sketch repeated Mr. Trump’s angry repudiation of the news media organization BuzzFeed, which he called “a failing pile of garbage. ” (In the sketch, Mr. Baldwin said he was dissatisfied with the results of a BuzzFeed quiz. “I’m not a Joey, I’m a Rachel,” he said, referring to the “Friends” characters.) There was also a gentle reenactment of Mr. Trump’s refusal to take questions from the CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta. “You’re fake news,” Mr. Baldwin said in the sketch. “I tried to watch your network last night, and there was just some crazy blond woman spouting lies. ” Bobby Moynihan, playing Mr. Acosta, answered: “That was Kellyanne Conway. ” Finally, after acknowledging to a reporter that Russia probably played a role in hacking the election, Mr. Baldwin took one last question from the cast member Beck Bennett. Though the   Mr. Bennett clearly appeared to be playing President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, he said, in a thick Russian accent, “I am American journalist Wolf Blitzer. Are you sure Russia was behind hacking?” Then he held up a potentially incriminating videotape and asked, “But are you really, really sure?” Mr. Baldwin stammered in reply, “It was China. I mean Canada. It was Meryl Streep. ” Ever since Mr. Trump hosted the program in November 2015 while still vying for the Republican presidential nomination, he has made no secret of his dislike for how “Saturday Night Live” and Mr. Baldwin have portrayed him. After some sketches this season, Mr. Trump has gone on his Twitter account to air his grievances, writing, for example, that the show is “unwatchable,” “totally biased” and “not funny,” and that Mr. Baldwin’s impersonation of him “just can’t get any worse. ” At other times, Mr. Trump has not responded to the show. During Saturday’s opening monologue, Tina Fey, the “S. N. L. ” alumna and “30 Rock” star, offered some advice to the actress Felicity Jones, a   guest host. No matter how the show goes, Ms. Fey said, “The president of the United States will say that it’s sad and overrated. ” She added, “It’s fine, no one cares. ” And then TV viewers warily turned their eyes to Twitter to see what, if anything, would happen next. Late Sunday afternoon, Mr. Trump did respond with a tweet critical of the show, caling it “the worst of NBC,” adding, “Really bad television!”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

Democracy grants people the right to protest, to show their opinion on matters that affect their lives and their nation’s. Protesting is a universally acknowledged fact belonging to the modern world. It serves to give voice to those who are disturbed by the faulty policies, drawbacks and negligence of their governments and who wish to raise public awareness on these matters. Demonstrations, rallies, strikes, pickets, boycotts and so on are all ways of protesting. As long as they are within the limits defined by the “law,” protests and acts of similar nature are in essence an indisputable part of democracy, freedom of opinion and expression.
However, in some cases protesting is exploited and used as a means of opposing democracy itself. Protests that give way to riots are now methods of staging coups to shut down administrations and overthrow democratically elected governments.
Legitimacy of Protests and Feasibility of Demands
Democratic protests are welcomed by societies and addressed by governments to the extent that their demands are tangible, justified and feasible . Protests lacking those qualities are most likely to fail in having their demands met.
The anti-government movement in Bulgaria in 2013-14 confirmed the validity of these qualities. The protests took place in three separate cycles. January and February witnessed rallies that objected to the high prices of electricity and demanded the government resign. They were successful as the requests were sensible. A later demonstration was against a government officer, and resulted in his resignation. Yet another cycle of protests called for a change of the system, along with some other illegal demands and faced defeat after turning into riots that were not supported by the overall society.

Gruesome Video Shows Turkish Soldiers Execute Female Kurdish PKK Fighters by Shooting in Their Heads 2 bombers, stopped by police, blew themselves up in Turkey Dispute over Kurds and Coup attempt threatens U.S.-Turkey alliance The attempted coup d’état made Turkey band together The Gezi Park protests in Turkey in the same year followed the same pattern. Set in motion with a good willed and environmentalist approach, it was likely to succeed considering its solid and feasible calls and legitimate ways at first. The government heeded the nature lovers’ voices and took a positive step by postponing a construction project that required the destruction of Gezi Park. Yet the humanist approach of young people changed course in the wake of provocations of separatist and terrorist gangs and turned into a totally different nature. Demonstrations that began in Gezi Park in Istanbul and that demanded the preservation of Gezi Park as a recreational area spread to other cities of the country and transformed into armed and bloody uprising imposing the fall of government. It was a quite clear coup d’etat attempt that did not refrain from using violent methods and openly rejected the validity of a democratically elected government. The protests were contradictory considering people took to streets using their democratic rights, but then appealed to non-democratic methods to lay their claims ignoring the will of the nation.
Though justified at the beginning, these two cases of protests demonstrate that they are open to hostile manipulations and may lose their legitimacy if left at the hands of ill-minded people. Recently some dark powers have been using this latest technique to manage countries’ internal affairs as they see fit and stage coups to overthrow governments. They bring in professional teams of brutal killers amidst peaceful protests, which then lead to violent anti-democratic clashes. These protests sometimes end up in civil wars where fellows of the same nation kill one another. It all happens in the wake of a government’s non-yielding to some dark power’s demands and a democratically elected government faces anti-democratic attempts.
Methods of Provocations and OTPOR
Such dramatic outcomes come by the employment of social media. Social media becomes an instrument for organizing, stirring and agitating the masses that are presumed to join the demonstrations. Various provocative organizations undertake the organization of some agents and provocateurs who take part in demonstrations by inciting them to get violent. These illegal “subcontractors” organize the public relations part of the riots and channel intellectual circles of the country such as its authors, academicians, journalists and members of non-governmental institutions to act against democratically elected government in the name of democracy and to lead the public.
One of the most common groups among these “ professional revolutionary organizations ” is a Serbia-based resistance organization,OTPOR . Independent observers state that OTPOR organizes coup attempts and civil disturbance by providing training and logistic support for the US-backed dissident organizations in many countries such as the former Yugoslavia, Serbia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Egypt, Brazil, and Turkey. There is a consensus that the CIA has been creating riots and social disturbances in fifty countries OTPOR its offshoot CANVAS…
A relevant source puts forward the following interesting findings OTPOR :
The (OTPOR 's ) fist-logo, would turn up 11 years later in the streets of Cairo , illustrating further the preposterous, foreign-backed nature of the Egyptian uprisings... Serbia’s OTPOR would continue receiving funds from the West and become a “CIA-coup college” of sorts under the name of CANVAS (Center for Applied Non-Violent Action and Strategies ).
The research article penned by Carl Gibson and Steve Horn and published on “Occupy.com” deals with the international financial, intelligence and political connections of OTPOR and features the following information based on WikiLeaks documents:
Serbia’s Srdja Popovic is known by many as a leading architect of regime changes in Eastern Europe and elsewhere since the late-1990s , and as one of the co-founders of OTPOR… Popovic and OTPOR's offshoot CANVAS have also maintained close ties with a Goldman Sachs executive and the private intelligence firm Stratfor as well as the U.S. government …
Such examples are easy to find. The internal public opinion on OTPOR is that it is being employed as leverage to overthrow those governments which conflict with the interests of the U.S. No wonder some media organizations that act on behalf of the US administration speak highly of OTPOR at every turn. Moreover, the British media rigorously advocates that the executives of OTPOR have nothing to do with the organization of coups.
Likewise, some Turkish media organizations disseminated similar statements during the 2013 Gezi Park demonstrations. The attempt to occupy the Prime Minister’s residence by armed groups, which is an act of rebellion against the state and treason by law, was orchestrated by OTPOR, according to reports. Yet the media deliberately defined it as “the exercise of legitimate, democratic rights, and freedom of expression by the people,” and thus desired to create misapprehension to display the members of the Marxist and separatist terrorist organizations who are far from representing even a slightest portion of the nation as the representatives of the nation. These media organs called the nation’s security forces who risked their lives to preserve public order and people’s lives as ‘the so-called enemies of freedom and democracy.’

0,WELFake Dataset,"Russia's countersanctions for Syria will hit the West below the belt 08.11.2016 Print version Font Size The West and Russia are entering the third year of the war of sanctions . Washington threatens to impose new sanctions against Russia, this time for Syria. Russia will take ""painful measures"" in response, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said. Pravda.Ru offers the list of counter sanctions that we made up on the basis of experts' opinions. 1. Russia's first answer would be the abolition of neo-liberal economic policies and transition to a new economic development strategy . This will block channels of Western influence on our country and thus become the most asymmetric, but a tough answer to Western sanctions, said Ruslan Dzarasov, Doctor of Economics, head of the department of political economy at the Russian Economic University named after Plekhanov.The expert noted that ""we continue to adhere to the export growth model, taking capital to the West and forming the budget on the basis of financial interests of capital rather than domestic consumers."" Russia, the expert said, should introduce a combination of state planning and market sector, ""similar to what the USSR was doing during the 1920s .""""The state should ensure the financial transparency of corporations, expand the rights of trade unions and workers, strengthen social control over big business, show influence on the formation prices in economy to eliminate price disparity in favor of the mining export sector to the detriment of the manufacturing industry,"" Ruslan Dzarasov told Pravda.Ru.2. Russia could refuse from saving its reserves in US dollars . Russia does not take the first place in terms of dollar savings in the world, but it could still cause a serious blow on the Western financial system, Valentin Katasonov, Doctor of Economics, Professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Finance, the head of Russian Economic Society named after S.F. Sharapov, told Pravda.Ru.""A lot of Russia's liabilities in national gold and currency reserves are nominated in US dollars. Should they are put on the market, the US dollar will suffer greatly ,"" leading expert at the Union of Oil and Gas Industrialists, Rustam Tankan said. Noteworthy, some privately run Russian companies already abandon the US dollar in their activities. Megafon, one of Russia's three leading cellular providers, converted about 40 percent of dollar deposits in euros and Hong Kong dollars. The company transferred the funds to accounts in major Chinese banks. Norilsk Nickel took similar measures. The Hong Kong dollar is a Chinese foreign clone of the dollar, and the USA is unable to impose any sanctions on this currency . Russia has started abandoning from the US dollar as a reserve currency by opening the Raw Materials Exchange of St. Petersburg, where Russian energy carriers are traded in rubles. 3. Russia could freeze assets of US investors in the Russian economy . ""Foreign citizens are the ultimate beneficiaries of our shadow holdings. There are tricky financial mechanisms in the timber industry, for instance,"" Igor Gerasimov, member of the Committee for Business Security at the Chamber of Commerce, security expert, told Pravda.Ru. The shadow mechanism works as follows. A wood-working company does most of the work, while most of the profit goes to a ""general contractor."" The latter pays the company a relative price for production, plus a minimum profit. Most of the profit goes to specific individuals, to accounts of foreign companies. Therefore, Russia could adopt laws about the nationalization of natural resources and city-forming enterprises, said Igor Gerasimov.4. The State Duma of the Russian Federation has already discussed a draft law to relieve state-run and privately-owned Russian companies from debts totaling $700 billion . These debts are held by Western banks of the countries that threatened to impose sanctions against Russia.5. Sanctions in the field of high technology will be no less sensitive. ""Russian titanium will cease to arrive at European companies, and this will certainly be a very significant act of pressure on our partners,"" Alexei Mukhin, general director of the Center for Political Information told Pravda.Ru. Boeing and United Technologies, as well as Europe's Airbus Group, purchase most of their titanium from Avisma, a Russian company, which happens to be the world's largest titanium producer . Yet, it goes about only 30 percent of needs. The USA remains entirely dependent on Russia in the field of rocket engines . RD-180 is a six-ton ​​liquid rocket engine with a thrust of more than 400 tons. The USA has been using Russian rocket engines since 2000. US Congress passed the budget, which provided for the allocation of hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase an ""unlimited"" number of RD-180 rocket engines. 6. Russia's sanctions against Western airlines would lead to their elimination . A great deal of airlines fly across the territory of Russia and save a lot of money on this, chairman of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, Andrei Klimov, told Pravda.Ru.""If all of a sudden, the Russian authorities try to do something in this field, it will generate huge profits to companies from such countries as the United Arab Emirates, but at the same time it will cause serious financial damage to German, French and other air carriers,"" - said the expert.7. Many large companies in the West have a strong lobby in legislative authorities. Therefore, the input of targeted sanctions under the pretext of violation of rules and regulations would be a very strong response . Starting from 1 November 2016, Russia banned imports of salt from the EU, the US, Canada, Australia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Montenegro, Albania and Ukraine. On February 15, 2016 Russia banned imports of soybeans and corn from the United States, including through third countries. Russia still imports various food products from the United States, spending millions of dollars a year (PepsiCo, Starbucks, Cargill, McDonald's), pharmaceuticals (Pfizer), cosmetic products (Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson), plastics, machinery, textiles, footwear, automobiles (Ford, General Motors) as well as products under the ""secret code"" worth $554 million in the first half of 2016.

0,WELFake Dataset,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio presented an $82.1 billion preliminary budget for the city’s 2016-17 financial year on Thursday, noting the city’s strong economic position but striking a cautionary note over the economic outlook.  New York City, which sits at the center of one of the biggest regional economies in the world, has seen strong growth since the recession that followed the 2007-09 financial crisis. That has allowed officials to build budget reserves, but doubts remain whether that growth will continue. “There are lots of real challenges that are coming through to make us uncertain about what our economic future is,” de Blasio said during a presentation at City Hall. “We as New York City have to protect ourselves.” The mayor highlighted concerns over China’s economy, question marks over global growth, the current plunge in the U.S. stock market and terrorism as threats to the city. The city added 213,000 jobs in 2014 and 2015, the strongest two-year gain in recent history. The number of jobs are at an all time high of 4.2 million. Yet de Blasio said the economy may be overdue for a recession and pointed to the devastating effects of the last recession. The budget has nearly $5 billion in budget reserves, including $3.4 billion for retiree health benefits and $1 billion in general reserves in case the city has to “go it alone” during a recession, de Blasio said. The total budget represents a small increase over the previous year’s $81.7 billion. De Blasio, a left-leaning Democrat who took office at the start of 2014, highlighted signature programs such as raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour for all city workers, an initiative that will cost the city $115 million when fully implemented. He also outlined plans to tackle the city’s homelessness problem through millions of dollars for shelter repair, prevention initiatives and programs to move people out of shelters to permanent housing. Dean Fuleihan, the city budget director, said the budget was balanced in the current and coming financial year. He said $1 billion in savings in the 2016-17 budget will come from reductions in debt service and savings in agency spending. The city’s public pension system will consume a larger chunk of revenues as increased mortality projections mean the city will have to pay an additional $600 million. That brings the city’s total annual pension bill to $9.4 billion. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon went on a rant about the dysfunction in DC during the company s earnings conference call Friday: The U.S. has become  one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet Dimon had been considered for a position in President Trump s cabinet. He s been an adviser to Trump too. While there are some things Dimon clearly disagrees with the president on, they are able to work together: He is the President of the United States. I believe he is the pilot flying our airplane,  Dimon said,  I would try to help any President of the United States because I m a patriot. During the bank s annual meeting in May, 2016, Dimon reportedly commented on what he thinks the government should work on:Dimon emphasized the areas he believes are in serious need of fixing, including education, infrastructure, and tax reform. Our corporate tax system is driving capital and brains overseas and excessive regulation is reducing growth and business formation particularly for small businesses. THE STUPID SH*T WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN THIS COUNTRY It s almost embarrassment to be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s  we have to deal with in this country,  Dimon said in response to an analyst question. Since the Great Recession, which is now 8 years old, we ve been growing at 1.5 to 2 percent in spite of stupidity and political gridlock, because the American business sector is powerful and strong,  he said.  What I m saying is that it would be much stronger growth if there were more intelligent decisions and less gridlock. The executive of the U.S. banking giant cited travels to countries such as France, Argentina, Israel and Ireland. The U.S. has become  one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet  and  it s hurting the average American that we don t have these right policies,  he said.JPMorgan Chase reported earnings that handily beat Wall Street estimates Friday. However, the bank lowered its forecast for lending revenue.DC has been in gridlock over the health care bill, which is holding up the passage of new legislation on tax reform. The Senate cut short its August recess by two weeks in order to deal with health care. There are about a dozen Senators opposed to the current bill citing the possibility that this new health care bill is  Obamacare lite . Senator Rand Paul has voiced strong opposition to this new bill.Here s the transcript from Dimon:Since the Great Recession which is now eight years old we ve been growing at 1.5 to 2% despite the stupidity and political gridlock. Because the American business sector is powerful and strong and is going to grow regardless of they went to feed their kids and want to buy home they want to do things the same as American businesses what I m saying is it would be much stronger growth had we made intelligent decisions and that gridlock, and thank you for pointing it out because I m going to be a broken record until this gets done, we are unable to build bridges, unable to build airports, not graduating.I was just in France, in Argentina, Israel, Ireland we met with the Prime Minister of India and China it s amazing to me that every single one of those countries understands that practical policies to promote business growth is good for the average citizens of those countries for jobs and wages and somehow this great American free enterprise system we no longer get it.My view is corporate taxation is critical to that by the way regarding capital brings overseas, which is why the $2 trillion overseas benefiting all these other countries don t like that, so if we don t get our act together we can still grow. It s just unfortunate but it s hurting us, it s hurting the body politic, it s hurting the average American that we don t have these right policies. So no in spite of gridlock we will grow at 1   or 2%.I don t buy the argument that we are relegated to this effort. We are not this administration can make breakthroughs in taxes and infrastructure ready for reform we have become one of the most bureaucratic confusing litigious societies on the planet it s almost an embarrassment be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s  we have to deal with in this country and at one point we have to get our act together. We won t do what were supposed to for the average Americans and unfortunately people write about this like corporations is not corporations competitive taxes are important for business and business growth which is important to jobs in wage growth and we should be making that along to every single one of you every time you talk to a client.VIA: CNBC",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

The mall was shut down shortly before 6 p.m. and cleared out in response. It was supposed to remain open until 9 p.m.According to Manchester Police Capt.

A lot of them aren t hanging out in the streets so they come here, typically, and hang out at the mall. The mall released the following statement Tuesday morning:Buckland Hills has closed for the evening.

We are working closely with law enforcement and direct all inquiries to the Manchester Police Department.

Then, several hundred teens at various other locations throughout the mall started fighting at the same time.Davis said some veteran Manchester officers who were at Buckland Hills on Monday night noticed more teens than usual.

0,WELFake Dataset,"KABUL (Reuters) - NATO countries have strong reasons to maintain support for Afghanistan and will respond to U.S. President Trump s call for more troops and funding, the alliance s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday.  It is in the interest of Europe, of NATO allies to help stabilize Afghanistan,  Stoltenberg said during a visit to Kabul with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, which was overshadowed by a militant attack on Kabul airport. Trump made clear last month that he expected NATO to step up its contribution in Afghanistan when he announced a tougher new strategy against the Taliban and other militant forces. However the political reaction in Europe has been mixed with little public appetite for more involvement. In Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is working to form a government after last weekend s election, her conservative party backs the mission. But senior figures from her two likely coalition partners, the liberal Free Democrats and environmental Greens, have expressed scepticism. In Italy, the anti-establishment 5-Star party, riding high in opinion polls ahead of elections early next year, has said it would pull Italy s force of more than 1,000 troops out.  Germany has been a strong supporter of the NATO mission in Afghanistan for many many years,  Stoltenberg said.  Germany is the lead nation in the north (of Afghanistan) and I m absolutely certain that Germany will continue to provide support.  Stoltenberg said NATO assistance was aimed at ensuring Afghanistan did not become  a safe haven for international terrorism.  But he reiterated that NATO troops would not be returning to the combat role they ended in 2014 and would continue training and advising Afghan forces as well as providing equipment and funding.  We are not going back to the big combat operations we had before. It will still be a non-combat operation.  Stoltenberg said Afghan forces, which have suffered thousands of casualties fighting the insurgency, had been  managing a very difficult situation . But they had prevented the Taliban from gaining control of any major provincial centers and would be boosted by plans to strengthen the Afghan Air Force and Special Forces units.  There will be setbacks but if we look at what we have achieved so far, we have been able to build a strong Afghan national security force and we ll build it even stronger.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Hillary Campaign Launching Attacks on the FBI October   
If the Clinton campaign becomes any more deranged, Hillary will start running attack ads against the FBI. This kind of tactic is already perilously close to an attack ad. 
Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign ratcheted up its attack on the director of the FBI on Sunday, circulating a draft letter critical of James Comey to former federal prosecutors. 
“It is out of our respect for such settled tenets of the United States Department of Justice that we are moved to express our concern with the recent letter issued by FBI Director James Comey to eight Congressional Committees,” the Clinton campaign’s letter speaking for prosecutors said. 
The letter was signed and provided to The Daily Beast by Elkan Abramowitz, a former chief of the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. It is expected to be released Sunday evening. 
So we have the bizarre spectacle of Hillary deciding that she needs to campaign against the head of the FBI, who was just being praised for clearing her, because when you're a paranoid personality who assembles lists of enemies, this is how you react.

0,WELFake Dataset,"HANOI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had insulted him by calling him “old” and said he would never call Kim “short and fat.” Trump made the comment after attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam. In a series of tweets he also said Chinese President Xi Jinping was “upping sanctions” on North Korea in response to its nuclear and missile programs and that Xi wanted Pyongyang to “denuclearize.” During Trump’s visit to Beijing last week Xi reiterated that China would strive for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula but offered no hint it would change tack on North Korea, with which it fought side by side in the 1950-53 Korean war against U.S.-led forces. One of Trump’s tweets read: “Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ‘old,’ when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat?’ Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!” Speaking later in Vietnam’s capital, Hanoi, Trump said “it would be very, very nice” if he and Kim became friends. “That might be a strange thing to happen but it’s a possibility,” he said. Trump has traded insults and threats with Kim in the past amid escalating tension over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs as North Korea races toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States -something Trump has vowed to prevent. North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb test on Sept. 3, prompting another round of U.N. sanctions. In September Kim described Trump as a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard” whom he would tame with fire. His comments came after Trump threatened in his maiden United Nations address to “totally destroy” the country of 26 million people if the United States were threatened. After North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho addressed the U.N. General Assembly in September Trump tweeted: “Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won’t be around much longer!” North Korea has conducted dozens of ballistic missile tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions. It has vowed to never give up its weapons programs, saying they are necessary to counter hostility from the United States and its allies. The United States has said that all options, including military, are on the table, although its preference is for a diplomatic solution. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

The employee quickly jumped out the window, ran to the car, and put the car in park to stop its roll. “In that moment, I thought, I’d rather save that woman’s life,” Viloria told WPLG. “I see she’s like inflating her neck, like trying to breathe, like ‘ahh,’ and basically I thought something was going wrong. ” “I thought, ‘If those kids lose their mother today, that’s going to be tragic,’” Viloria told the media. “Her kids were screaming, ‘Mother, mother, stop it, Mother what are you doing? ’” Viloria added. Even as the valorous employee jumped into action, a firefighter paramedic happened to be walking onto the Doral, Florida, restaurant and after learning of the situation, quickly ran outside to give aide to the driver.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he hoped “cooler heads will prevail” and that the Republican-led Senate will act on his U.S. Supreme Court nominee but top Republicans dug in their heels, defending their refusal to consider anyone Obama picks. Obama has narrowed to five his list of candidates to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. Obama’s nominee could tip the nine-member court to the left for the first time in decades. The Republicans who control the Senate have vowed not to hold confirmation hearings or an up-or-down vote on anyone Obama picks, saying the choice should belong to the next president who takes office in January after the Nov. 8 presidential election. “My hope is that cooler heads will prevail and people will reflect on what’s at stake here once a nomination is made,” Obama said at a news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The White House is interviewing five candidates, federal judges Sri Srinivasan, Jane Kelly, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Paul Watford and Merrick Garland, according to a source familiar with the process. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, whose panel handles Supreme Court nominations, offered a lengthy defense of the Senate Republicans’ stance. Grassley accused Democrats of a “charade” with feigned outrage over the Republican refusal to consider Obama’s nominee simply to “score as many political points as possible.” “Regardless of what some are willing to admit publicly, everybody knows any nominee submitted in the middle of this presidential campaign isn’t getting confirmed. Everybody. The White House knows it. Senate Democrats know it. Republicans know it. Even the press knows it,” Grassley told a committee hearing. Under the U.S. Constitution, the president selects a Supreme Court nominee and the Senate confirms or rejects the nominee. “I’m going to do my job,” Obama said, promising an “eminently qualified” nominee. “And it will then be up to Senate Republicans to decide whether they want to follow the Constitution and abide by the rules of fair play that ultimately undergird our democracy and that ensure that the Supreme Court does not just become one more extension of our polarized politics,” Obama said.  Denis McDonough, Obama’s chief of staff, and other presidential aides met with Judiciary Committee Democrats at the White House on the nomination. Afterward, the Democratic senators predicted Republicans would buckle under public pressure and drop their “obstruction” once Obama names his nominee. “We are optimistic that, soon enough, not only will the president nominate, but our Republican colleagues will see the light,” said U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, forecasting that Obama’s nominee will be confirmed with bipartisan support. Separately, one Republican senator indicated Senate Republicans would act on a nominee if they had a Republican president. “If a conservative president’s replacing a conservative justice, there’s a little more accommodation to it,” Wisconsin’s Ron Johnson told a radio interviewer. “President Obama’s nominee would flip the court from a 5-4 conservative to a 5-4 liberal-controlled court. And that’s the concern,” Johnson added. THE GRASSLEY-KELLY CONNECTION Grassley in 2013 spoke in favor of Kelly’s nomination to the St. Louis-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. She was confirmed by a 96-0 Senate vote. Kelly, an Obama classmate at Harvard Law School, is based in Iowa and previously served as a federal public defender there. The Iowa senator rejected any notion he could be persuaded to drop his opposition if Obama were to nominate a candidate previously confirmed by him and other Republicans. He denounced the idea that the White House selection process was “guided by the raw political calculation of what they think will exert the most political pressure on me.” Choosing someone like Kelly from Iowa would be an “obvious political ploy” that would fail, Grassley added. Senator Orrin Hatch, another Judiciary Committee Republican, said in an interview that Garland, whose previous nomination to the appellate court he backed, is “a fine man” who would be “a moderate choice” for the high court.  But Hatch said he opposed acting even on Garland. “It isn’t a question about the person in my opinion. It’s a question about the timing ... and the atmosphere that we have around here, which is poisonous,” Hatch said. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid delivered his latest attack on Grassley, saying on the Senate floor that it was “a little strange, a little odd” that Grassley would not hold hearings even for Kelly, considering his past support. Iowa’s Tom Miller, a Democrat, was among a group of attorneys general from 19 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico who sent a letter to Grassley and other Senate leaders urging them to act promptly on Obama’s nominee.

0,WELFake Dataset,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - At least 33 people died in the Kenyan capital Nairobi during a police crackdown on opposition supporters after elections in August, including a child and a pregnant woman, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said on Monday. Protests erupted after President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared winner over opposition leader Raila Odinga in the vote. The Supreme Court later voided the result. Odinga has withdrawn from a re-run on Oct. 26, leaving Kenyatta as the only candidate, prompting further protests.    Kenyan police disputed the rights groups  report, which brings the nationwide death toll in the crackdown to at least  45. Human Rights Watch had earlier documented 12 killings after the vote by police in western Kenya, the main opposition stronghold.         HRW and Amnesty said police in Nairobi had used  excessive force  and that  most of (the 33 who died) were killed as a result of action by the police.  Among them was a nine-year-old child shot dead while standing on a balcony and a woman who was eight months pregnant and was trampled to death after fainting from inhaling tear gas, the rights groups said in the report. Kenya s National Police Service said in a statement the report was  totally misleading and based on falsehoods.   Immediately after the violence in August, police said only  criminals  and  thugs  had been killed or injured.      The report is likely to bolster the case of Kenyan activists and rights groups who accuse police of brutality and extrajudicial killings but say few officers are charged and convictions are extremely rare.  Researchers found that although police behaved appropriately in some instances, in many others they shot or beat protesters to death,  the groups said in the report.       On Thursday the government banned demonstrations in the central business district of Nairobi, the coastal city of Mombasa and the western city of Kisumu, where protesters had been gathering twice a week, calling on the election board to make reforms to ensure a fair poll. Police had used tear gas to disperse them.[L8N1MO1O3] A group of U.N. human rights experts called for the government s ban on protests to be listed and denounced a  pattern of police brutality  in response to recent demonstrations. During the violence the parents of a six-month-old baby in western Kenya told Reuters their child was clubbed by police in her home and died later in hospital from brain trauma.  Kenya receives financial support for security from the United States, Britain and other international donors. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

His actions, throughout his career, have spoken louder than words.From his $100 million donation to Newark, New Jersey schools, to giving $25 million in the fight against Ebola, to most recently saying this in a Facebook post to his new daughter:Now, in yet another Facebook post, Zuckerberg offered his New Years resolution which included reading two books a month, creating a Jarvis from  Iron Man  artificial butler for his own personal use, and exploring the future advancement of technology.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Every year, I take on a personal challenge to learn new things and grow outside my work at Facebook.

0,WELFake Dataset,"BUDAPEST  —   Lawmakers in Hungary on Tuesday rejected a proposed national ban on refugees relocated from the rest of the European Union, dealing a rare defeat to Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Mr. Orban submitted a plan to ban the refugees, in the form of a constitutional amendment, last month, after a similar proposal failed to pass by referendum because of insufficient voter turnout. He has vowed to block a European Union program that would resettle migrants from the Middle East and Africa who have gone to countries like Greece and Italy. Under that program, Hungary, a nation of 10 million, would have to accept  1, 294 of a total of about 160, 000 migrants. The amendment needed   of sitting members of the   Parliament to pass. It got 131 votes on Tuesday  —   two shy of the necessary threshold. Three lawmakers voted no, and the rest abstained. The   Jobbik party, which is part of the official opposition but usually sides with Mr. Orban’s Fidesz party on migration issues, was crucial to the defeat of the amendment. Gabor Vona, a lawmaker and the leader of Jobbik, said that his party would support only a solution that “defends Hungary and Hungarian people, not just from poor migrants but from rich migrants, not just from poor terrorists but from rich terrorists. ” He was referring to a rule that allows foreigners who invest over 300, 000 euros, or about $332, 000, in Hungarian bonds to acquire residency. The program dates to 2012, but it has drawn attention recently, after reports that Hungarian bonds could be bought in places like Erbil, Iraq. Critics say that allowing migrants to settle in Hungary could open the door to terrorists from unstable countries like Iraq, and they say the residency program might open the door to corruption. The Fidesz party has been politically weaker since last year, when it lost its supermajority in Parliament. That advantage had allowed Mr. Orban’s government to rewrite the Constitution and to pass legislation to rein in the judiciary and the press, packing some of the country’s top institutions with political allies. Lajos Kosa, an ally of Mr. Orban who leads Fidesz lawmakers in Parliament, said before the vote on Tuesday that the Jobbik party would be “joining the ranks of traitors” if it rejected the amendment. “Hungary can only count on Fidesz and K. D. N. P. in the struggle against migration,” he said as he emerged from the vote, using the initials for the Christian Democratic People’s Party, which is part of the governing coalition. “We are naturally going to continue the struggle,” he said, noting that more than three million voters in the referendum had opted to support the ban on migrants. On Tuesday, analysts were cautious in interpreting the defeat of the amendment as a sign of the government’s declining political power. “I wouldn’t say that this is a huge failure for Orban  —   it’s a failure, but a minor one,” said Csaba Toth, the director of strategy for the Republikon Institute, a research and advocacy group that has been critical of Mr. Orban’s government. “This is the second time the government can’t have their own way, which is important for a group whose main governing strategy is power. ” Last year, Mr. Orban and his government began an aggressive campaign against migrants, particularly those from the Middle East, as hundreds of thousands crossed Hungary’s southern border, most of them en route to Germany. The number of crossings fell nearly to zero after Hungary built a   fence along sections of the border and as the flow of migrants shifted away from the Balkans. Nonetheless, Fidesz’s campaign against migration has continued, and the party’s stance has seized both attention and voters from Jobbik, which had been the main voice for   nationalists. Mr. Toth, the analyst, said that the vote on Tuesday could be seen as an attempt by Jobbik to improve its political standing. “It can say that corruption is more important to Fidesz than the fight against quotas,” he said.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"J.K. Rowling is best known for her magical world of Harry Potter, filled with ghostly Dementors, tricky house-elves, butter beer, and spells that enchant or dispel an opponent. Her spellbound books do not stop there. Rowling has written other books, which are geared toward adults, such as her crime novel, “The Cuckoo Calling,” currently being filmed for BBC adaptation. Rowling also wrote “The Casual Vacancy,” a drama novel that has already made its debut on the BBC network.
J.K. Rowling’s Bookcase of Magic Rowling went on to expand her extraordinary world of magic with “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” which is her next installment into a magical place young adults, children, and adults alike want to be in. The book was originally meant to be a textbook in the wizarding world of Hogwarts and centers around Newt Scamander.
In the year 1926, he has completed a global excursion to find and document all of the world’s magical creatures. Unfortunately, after Scamander decides to make a brief stop in New York, he misplaces his magical case of fantastic beasts. (Yes, the world of magic has come to America.) He also meets a No-Maj named Jacob Kowalski, who discovers the world of magic after meeting Scamander and causes a bit of mischief.
The immersive world of magic continues in Rowling’s “Quidditch Through the Ages.” Even though the book is not as magical as previous ones, it is still essential to the wizarding world. It is about Quidditch and was written by Kennilworthy Whisp, a renowned player of the sport. This book was read by Potter in the movie, “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.” Severus Snape caught him reading it outside the school, and makes a bogus rule that library books are no longer allowed outside the school, before he takes from Potter.
A Collection of Wizarding Tales for Children Who can forget Rowling’s collection of the popular wizarding fairy tales for children called, “The Tales of Beedle the Bard?” This book is featured in “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.” Hermione Granger is bequeathed the book by Albus Dumbledore. It is a series of five stories:
“The Warlock’s Hairy Heart,” is a story about a young warlock who has been jilted by love and vows to never fall in love again. In order to do this, he uses The Dark Arts, which saddens his family. Consequently, servants start to whisper about him not having a wife. He decides he will find the most beautiful and talented woman to gain the envy of everyone. Soon, he meets a girl and invites her to dinner. She is fascinated and repulsed by him. She wants to know if he has a heart. The warlock shows her the crystal casket that holds his beating hairy heart. She then asks him to put the heart back in his chest, and he does so. However, his heart had been out of his body too long and developed savage tastes. It causes him to forcefully take her human heart. Unfortunately, he cannot magically remove the hairy heart from his chest, so he cuts it out with a knife. Thus, he and his love die, as he stands with both hearts in his hands. “The Wizard and the Hopping Pot,” is about an old man that is generous. He uses his pot to brew magical potions and antidotes for people in need. After his death, he leaves his son the pot. Unfortunately, he does not have his fathers virtues. Bitter from only receiving a pot, his son closes the door in the faces of those who need help. However, he feels awful for turning away those in need. Eventually, he starts to help the townspeople. “The Fountain of Fair Fortune,” is about a fountain, which a person can bathe in once a year. Doing so, helps that person gain answers to their problems. This is where three witches meet. Asha, who suffers from an incurable decease; Altheda, who is poor and powerless because she was robbed; and Amata is beside herself after her lover leaves her. On their journey to the fountain, they are joined by a knight named Sir Luckless, and they continue the journey together. Along the way, they face three challenges. The first is a giant worm who demands proof of pain. The second, a steep slope where they must bring the fruit of their labors. The third involves crossing a river, which requires them to pay with the treasures of their pasts. Amata passes all three challenges by using magic to withdrawl memories of her lover and dropping them into the water. Asha collapses at the fountain. Altheda saves her by brewing an invigorating potion, which also cures Asha of her disease. Altheda realizes she can use her skills to make money. Amata learns that removing the memory of her lover has removed her regrets. Thier need for the fountain was no more. Sir Luckless bathes in the water. After doing so, he falls at Amata’s feet and asks her to marry him. The moral of the story is the fountain never actually had magical powers. To solve one’s troubles in life, one must do so for themselves. “Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump,” is about a king who wants to keep all the magic for himself. In order to do so, he has to capture all the sorcerers in the kingdom. Then, he has to learn magic. He creates an army of witch hunters. Then calls for an instructor of magic. Unbeknownst to him, the instructor is a charlatan. The instructor is called to perform, with the king, in front of people. He is told if he cannot so this, he will be beheaded. The charlatan blackmails Babbitty, who is magical, into helping him. The charlatan is asked, by a brigade captain, to bring his dog back to life. Babbitty, however, is unable to fulfill the request and is exposed by the charlatan. “The Tale of the Three Brothers,” is about brothers traveling together. Upon their journey, they reach a treacherous river. To cross it, they make a magical bridge. Halfway across they meet Death, who is angry from the loss of the three potential victims. Death tricks them into believing he is impressed with them and grants them three wishes. The oldest brother asks for an unbeatable dueling wand, known as the Elder Wand. The middle brother requests the ability to resurrect the dead and is given the Resurrection Stone. The youngest does not trust Death, so he asks Death to stop following him. With reluctance, Death hands him his Cloak of Invisibility. The brothers leave, in different directions. The oldest brags about the powerful wand he possesses and is murdered in his sleep. The middle brother brings back his lover, who died before they could marry. Regretably, she is not herself and is full of sadness. Inevitably, the brother kills himself to be with his beloved. The youngest brother can not be found by Death, due to the cloak he hides under. After many years of evading Death, he decides to take the cloak off and give it to his son. Pleased with all he has achieved, he willfully greets Death, and they leave together as equals. The Magical and Interactive World of Pottermore Rowling launched Pottermore, in April of 2012. In the immersive world, players can enter Hogwarts as though they are students, acceptance letter and all. Just like the books and movies, players are sorted into a house, before they can go any further. A series of questions are asked by the Sorting Hat. Then, players are placed into, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, or Raven Claw. Once a house has been selected, the player must go virtual shopping to obtain the items on the list, in the acceptance letter. First years must bring:
A Uniform:
Three sets of plain black robes. 
One pointed black hat, for day wear.
One pair of protective gloves.
One black winter cloak.
All clothing must adorn name tags. Books:
“The Standard Book of Spells,” grade 1, by Miranda Goshawk.
“A History of Magic,” by Bathilda Bagshot.
“Magical Theory,” by Adalbert Waffling.
“A beginner’s Guide toTransfigurationn,” by Emeric Switch.
“One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi,” by Phyllida Spore.
“Magical Drafts and Potions,” by Aresnius Jigger.
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” by Newt Scamander.
“The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection,” by Quentin Trimble. Other equipment:
1 Wand
a pewter, size 2, Cauldron
a set of glass or crystal vials
1 telescope
1 set of brass scales
Students can also bring an owl, cat or toad. After obtaining what is needed for classes, players were able to attend a potions class, duel with other students in the great hall, and interact in the common rooms. The journey also gives players exclusive information, not previously revealed by Rowling, that includes over 18,000 words of additional content.
However, as of 2015, players on the website were shut out, so it could be overhauled. Unfortunately, most of the fun features were removed. Now, the site is for informational purposes and interaction with class peers. However, visitors are still sorted into houses and matched with a wand.
The Magical Giving Side of J.K. Rowling Rowling dropped off the Forbes billionaire list in 2012, for two reasons; she donated an estimated $160 million to charity and Britain’s high tax rates. Moreover, Rowling’s reputation for bestowing her wealth is insurmountable and causes fans to wonder why she has given so much of her earnings to those in need. Her answer was simple and heartfelt:
I think you have a moral responsibility when you’ve been given far more than you need, to do wise things with it and give intelligently.
Rowling donated to the Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Children’s High-Level Group, now known as Lumos, after the spell of light from her Harry Potter series. She has also helped finance the building of a regenerative neurology clinic, in Scotland. These are a few charities Rowling has helped financially.
Through her books, Rowling brought magical beings and creatures to the imaginations of children and adults, which in turn, allowed her to bring help to those in need through the proceeds. She is the light of inspiration to all of those around her.

0,WELFake Dataset,"The president's comments cap a geopolitical backlash sparked by Netanyahu's statement on Monday that a Palestinian state would not be established on his watch. The Israeli prime minister has since insisted that he remains open to a two-state solution under very specific, restrictive conditions. But the damage appears to have been done, with the White House offering only the most perfunctory of diplo-speak to obscure its frustrations.

""We indicated that that kind of rhetoric was contrary to what is the best of Israel's traditions. That although Israel was founded based on the historic Jewish homeland and the need to have a Jewish homeland, Israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly,"" said Obama. ""And I think that that is what's best about Israeli democracy. If that is lost, then I think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who don't believe in a Jewish state, but it also I think starts to erode the meaning of democracy in the country.""

In his first public comments on Tuesday's elections in Israel, Obama's deepest discomfort was saved for Netanyahu's Election Day warning about Arab Israeli voters going to the polls ""in droves.""

Though he pledged to keep working with the Israeli government on military and intelligence operations, Obama declined to say whether the United States would continue to block Palestinian efforts to secure statehood through the United Nations. In a phone conversation the two had on Thursday, he said he indicated to Netanyahu that ""it is going to be hard to find a path where people are seriously believing that negotiations are possible.""

""We take him at his word when he said that it wouldn't happen during his prime ministership, and so that's why we've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we don't see a chaotic situation in the region,"" the president said in an interview with The Huffington Post on Friday.

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is operating under the assumption that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not support the creation of a Palestinian state, despite the Israeli leader's post-election efforts to recast himself as amenable to a two-state solution.

Besides the pressing international matters, Obama also discussed challenges on the domestic front. In forceful terms, he chastised Senate Republicans for holding up his attorney general nominee , Loretta Lynch, and encouraged Democrats to buck demands that they first pass a human trafficking bill with a controversial anti-abortion provision.

""Our goal,"" he added, ""is to get this done in a matter of weeks, not months.""

Negotiators took a hiatus for the observation of Nowruz, the Iranian New Year. The president on Friday encouraged everybody involved to use that time to grow more ""comfortable with the current positions that are being taken.""

Standing in the way of that final deal, according to recent reports, are lingering disputes over limits on new types of centrifuges that Iran wants to develop and the pace of international sanctions relief to be given to the country after a deal is struck.

""Frankly,"" he said, ""they have not yet made the kind of concessions that are I think going to be needed for a final deal to get done. But they have moved, and so there's the possibility.""

While he expressed worry about the strain that Netanyahu had placed on Israel's democratic fabric, Obama did not see the Israeli prime minister's electoral victory as having a tangible impact on current negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. With just days to go before those talks between Iran, the U.S. and five other countries are scheduled to wrap, Obama offered a markedly sober assessment about the prospects for a deal.

An even bigger fight between the parties could be on the political horizon. The president flatly said that he would not sign an appropriations bill to fund the government if it did not alleviate the spending cuts brought about by sequestration. With spending cuts set to return in October 2015, his declaration ups the ante for lawmakers and portends another government shutdown showdown.

""I’ve been very clear. We are not going to have a situation where, for example, our education spending goes back to its lowest level since the year 2000,"" said Obama. ""We can’t do that to our kids, and I’m not going to sign it.""

Even without Congress' input, there are initiatives that Obama can pursue during his closing year-and-a-half in office. During the roughly 25-minute interview in the White House Cabinet Room, he said that two major ones will be coming.

""Relatively soon,"" Obama said, he will be raising the annual salary threshold at which companies are required to pay overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week. The president didn't tip his hand as to how much he would lift the current level of $23,600.

In addition, Obama said he would be exercising his pardon and clemency powers ""more aggressively for people who meet the criteria."" There has been ongoing criticism that he has utilized those powers less than many of his predecessors.

One place where Obama will not go in the closing months of his second term is back to the negotiating table over a ""grand bargain"" on long-term deficit or debt reduction. Despite Republican criticism that a crisis still looms, he insisted that the times allow for a different approach

""The truth is, is that circumstances changed,"" said Obama, when asked why he no longer highlights issues like entitlement reform. ""At that time, we were seeing significantly higher deficits, and the economy was just beginning to grow. We now know that we’ve got strong growth.""

His unwillingness to re-open those talks he had in 2010 and 2011 isn't indicative of some ideological drift, he added.

This is just the latest in the potentially long list of what we can expect to come from fake news conspiracies being spread by right-wing nutjobs.Richards started making threats back in January, saying things like  you gonna die, death is coming to you real soon,  according to court documents released on Wednesday. She also wrote,  Look behind you. It s death,  to the parent, who was identified as Len Pozner in a statement he released after Richards  arrest. Pozner s son Noah was the youngest victim of the Sandy Hook massacre.Pozner, who now resides in Florida and spends his time disproving these so-called  truthers,  said in his statement:We are comforted to know that the system is working to protect the victims of violent crime from re-victimization by potentially violent Hoaxers.Sadly, Lucy Richards is not the only one from this group of Sandy Hook  hoaxers  that has harassed or threatened Mr. Pozner. He s been dealing with this for years.According to The New York Times:The conspiracy theorists have criticized Mr. Pozner and his counterinvestigations of their work. Mr. Pozner has filed complaints with law enforcement, private companies, and the attorney general s office. He even wrote a 165-page book raising questions about a champion of the hoax theory according to a September article in New York Magazine. People don t understand what trolls are,  Pozner said,  If you don t feed them, they don t just go away. When Mr. Pozner asked a Florida Atlantic University professor, James F. Tracy, to stop posting photos of Noah, the professor sent him a certified letter asking for proof the boy existed.The professor, who was tenured, was soon fired and he blames Pozner.Professor Tracy didn t actually commit any crimes, no matter how disgusting his actions were, but Lucy Richards on the other hand   Richards committed 4 counts of felony threat transmission and if convicted will spend up to 20 years in prison.

0,WELFake Dataset,"LONDON  —   Germany’s largest bank appears in danger, sending stock markets worldwide on a wild ride. Yet the biggest source of worry is less about its finances than a vast tangle of unknowns  —   not least, whether Europe can muster the will to mount a rescue in the event of an emergency. In short, fears that Europe lacks the cohesion to avoid a financial crisis may be enhancing the threat of one. The immediate source of alarm is the health of Deutsche Bank, whose vast and sprawling operations are entangled with the fates of investment houses from Tokyo to London to New York. Deutsche is staring at a   fine from the Justice Department for its enthusiastic participation in Wall Street’s festival of toxic mortgage products in the years leading up to financial crisis of 2008. Given Deutsche’s myriad other troubles  —   a role in the manipulation of a financial benchmark, claims of trades that violated Russian sanctions and a generalized sense of confusion about its mission  —   the American pursuit of a stiff penalty comes at an inopportune time. It heightens the sense that Deutsche  —   whose shares have lost more than half their value this year  —   needs to secure additional investment, lest it leave itself vulnerable to some new crisis. The biggest worries center on what happens if Deutsche falls apart to the point that it threatens the globe with a financial shock  —   and whether new rules and buffers put in place since the last crisis will keep the pain from spreading. Regulations that took effect this year in the European Union standardize how member countries are supposed to handle the potential implosion of a large financial institution. Banks, too, have put aside more money to deal with potential losses. Deutsche could pose the first test of the new arrangement. Recent challenges have underscored concerns about the limits of solidarity in Europe. From the chaos of the sovereign debt crisis to the acrimony over an influx of refugees, European authorities have proved something less than an exemplar of coordinated government action. The European Union has become a focus of populist anger, further constraining options. And Germany has opposed bailouts for lenders in other lands, making a Deutsche rescue politically radioactive. All of which adds to worries that Deutsche amounts to a fire burning, one that might yet become an inferno, while the fire department is consumed with existential arguments over its purpose. If the alarm sounds, no one can be sure what, if anything, will happen. In the worst case  —   now highly unlikely  —   the bank could collapse, inciting a scramble to pull money from markets around the globe. Institutions that trade with Deutsche would feel an urge to collect their cash immediately. Given the scale of the bank’s balance sheet  —   1. 8 trillion euros, or more than $2 trillion  —   that inclination is likely to spread to every crevice of finance. Economies would grind to a halt. Jobs and fortunes would disappear. Despite murmurings in pundit quarters that this sort of situation may be unfolding, provoking comparisons with the catastrophic bankruptcy of the American investment banking giant Lehman Brothers eight years ago, most economists dismiss such talk as overwrought and overblown. Deutsche is sitting on cash reserves worth €240 billion, or about $269 billion. It has sold bonds that can be converted to equity should the need arise. The Justice Department’s proposed fine of $14 billion is viewed as the opening of a negotiation that could cost Deutsche a fraction of that amount  —   thinking that sent the stock surging on Friday. Not least, Deutsche Bank is a classic example of the species of financial animal known as Too Big To Fail. “We saw what happened with Lehman,” said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at LUISS, a university in Rome. “It’s impossible that the authorities would let something like that happen again. It has ties with all the banks in the world. It is highly leveraged. A disorderly default would be very, very difficult for the entire financial system. ” On both sides of the Atlantic, the financial crisis prompted the construction of new regulatory authorities and requirements that banks set aside more funds in reserve against troubles. “The system is much more robust and resilient because of the buffers,” said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institution in Brussels. “There are pockets of fragility, but broadly speaking, the system is better prepared. ” But the markets do not appear to fully buy that the defenses are secure. Deutsche is heavily involved in the trading of derivatives, the exotic financial instruments that were at the center of the 2008 crisis. Derivatives can be so   complex that no one fully grasps who owes what to whom until someone big enough to rattle markets suddenly cannot pay. Then, fear takes over, and investors dump holdings indiscriminately. This lowers the value of even solid assets on bank balance sheets, giving rise to further cause for concern. Because Deutsche has been dominated by its investment banking operations  —   meaning it is not sitting on a large pile of plain deposits as a cushion  —   it is especially vulnerable to such volatility. Fear, in other words, is not just a symptom of trouble but also a cause. This makes Deutsche’s problems the world’s problems. Not for nothing did the International Monetary Fund in June declare Deutsche to be “the most important net contributor to systemic risks” on earth. A collapse may be exceedingly unlikely. Yet the beginning would probably feel something like recent days. Thursday brought reports that hedge funds were quietly extracting their money from Deutsche’s coffers. The bank’s shares plummeted to a new low. Friday morning, Deutsche’s chief executive officer, John Cryan, released a letter to his staff offering assurances that the bank boasted “strong fundamentals. ” The stock recovered slightly on those comments, but the sense remained that the need for reassurance attested to concerns. The biggest form of insurance against panic is confidence that larger players  —   in this case, European authorities  —   stand at the ready to mount a rescue, should one be required. But confidence is not something Europe has proved terribly skilled at instilling. Its abilities to marshal a bailout are dubious. New rules introduced to discourage reckless investments by large financial institutions bar   bailouts. Germany has been adamant that these strictures be applied, rebuffing a recent attempt by the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, to secure an exemption allowing him to inject taxpayer money into the Italian banking system. The optics of Germany seeking a way around the rules for its largest lender would be especially problematic. The Deutsche chief and the German government both shot down a report that the bank had asked that a bailout be prepared. More broadly, Germany has been the most fervent voice that reckless economic pursuits should be punished, no matter the human toll. As Athens has negotiated with European authorities and the International Monetary Fund for a series of bailouts, Germany has demanded deep cuts to Greek public spending, sharply cutting pension payments to retirees. The Greek government used much of the bailout money to pay back debts to German banks. Against this backdrop, a German bailout of its largest bank would reinvigorate accusations that it uses the European Union as a cover to pursue its own national interests. This dynamic has force in the markets, presenting another factor that investors must absorb as the evaluate they risks of holding Deutsche’s debts and shares. “The fact that we don’t know the reaction of the authorities is a factor of uncertainty,” said Mr. Veron of Bruegel. Here is a feedback loop that amplifies the risks. The likelihood that Deutsche needs a rescue appears small, yet the possibility that a rescue could be forged seems close to nil. That tightens the pressure on Deutsche. And yet Deutsche’s stature may provide the decisive form of insurance. In event of emergency, the authorities might have to act, whatever the politics. “Deutsche Bank is so big and so systemically important that the rules will be bent,” Mr. Borri said. “If I were an investor, I would assume that the rules would be bent. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"in: Politics , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests “And I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her.” I realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre, but in this article I will explain why this could actually happen. We have just learned that the FBI has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650,000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Now that the FBI is going through these emails, it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime could be made by November 8th. Of course the most likely scenario is that Hillary Clinton will not be indicted before election day and that Americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Clinton campaign. But if the FBI does quickly take action, it is possible that Hillary Clinton could be forced from the race before election day, and that would require the Democrats to come up with a new candidate. In fact, there are already calls in the mainstream media for Clinton to willingly remove herself from the race. For example, the following comes from a Chicago Tribune article entitled “ Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside “… So what should the Democrats do now? If ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: They would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. Democrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. But what the author of that article does not understand is that Tim Kaine would not automatically take her place if Clinton steps down before the election. In a previous article , I included a quote from a U.S. News & World Report article that explained what would happen if Hillary Clinton was removed from the Democratic ticket for some reason prior to November 8th… If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year’s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members – a number that changes over time and is guided by the group’s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. So if this email scandal forced Hillary Clinton to exit the race at the last minute, a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee would gather to select a new nominee. Who would they choose? Let’s take a look at the top five options… #1 Tim Kaine He would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Hillary Clinton’s running mate. But to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition, and most Americans outside of the state of Virginia have very little familiarity with him. And at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail. In fact, attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens. So to me it seems unlikely that the DNC would select Kaine as the replacement nominee. #2 Joe Biden Vice-President Joe Biden has far more name recognition than Tim Kaine does, and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run … Vice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it. Biden was asked in an interview with CNN Saturday if news that the FBI was re-opening their criminal probe into Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run. But according to the vice president, the short answer is “no.” The only thing that kept him from running, Biden said, was the recent death of his son, Beau. Unfortunately for Biden, he suffers from many of the same things that Kaine does. Biden is boring, he is not very good on the campaign trail, and he doesn’t have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers. Biden would probably represent the “safest” choice for the Democrats, but he might not be a winning choice. #3 Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to Hillary Clinton, but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Bernie Sanders. First of all, he does not have any real loyalty to the Democrats. He has previously operated as an independent, and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over. Secondly, the Democratic establishment very much dislikes him, and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this. Thirdly, Democratic insiders fear that he would be “another McGovern” and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election. So even though he is very popular with the radical left, it appears that Sanders would be the least likely choice on this list. #4 Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren would be very popular with the “Bernie Sanders” wing of the party, and she would enable the party to replace Hillary Clinton with another woman. So she is definitely a possibility. But she does lack name recognition, and just like Sanders there would be concern that the Republicans would frame her candidacy as “another McGovern” because of her far left policies. #5 Michelle Obama One recent survey found that 67 percent of all Democrats would rather have a third term for Obama than a first term for Hillary Clinton. And these days Barack Obama’s approval rating is running anywhere from +9 to +11. So the thought of another Obama in the White House is not as far-fetched as you might think. Michelle Obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list, and she is generally very well-liked by the American people. And she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently. For instance, her recent speech in New Hampshire was lauded as “the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign” in a recent MSN article entitled “ In this campaign, Michelle Obama became more than just another political voice “… The speech, amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response, cemented Obama’s place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view Trump, but also on herself as a voice of moral authority. Three months before leaving the White House, she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title. “When you rise to a level like that, you see how much weight your words carry,” said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University. “We know she didn’t like politics. But she was impassioned by the language that was used, and she feels compelled to speak out. People listen to her.” If I were the Democrats, Michelle Obama is the one that I would select if a replacement nominee was needed, because she would give them the very best chance of winning against Donald Trump. Of course the Obamas are just as radical as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but the American people have become quite comfortable with them at this point. And I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her. In the final analysis, none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the FBI will move quickly enough to force Hillary Clinton out before election day, but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen. And if it does happen, it is going to turn politics in America completely upside down. Submit your review",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Conservative commentator and Trump hater Bill Kristol has been hinting at a third-party alternative to the GOP frontrunner for months. On Friday, Kristol tweeted that he had indeed found his candidate, and that he was the true principled conservative who would offer voters something real and unique.Well, it s been announced who this Republican savior is and it s National Review writer and constitutional lawyer David French.The man with absolutely no name recognition is the alternative to Trump   a guy who literally has his name plastered on skyscrapers.Congratulations, Republicans, you ve managed to make yourselves look more stupid than you already have. They could have put Romney on the ticket, who may have been the best choice to take on Clinton and Trump. In a moment of irony, just a week ago, French was calling on Romney to run third party, saying he was the  only hope  for the GOP s survival. How about that, not even the current third party candidate thinks he s good enough.And French doesn t even fit the description of what Kristol and his allies were searching for. According to Bloomberg Politics:According to one person deeply involved in the efforts to recruit an independent challenger, the search has focused on individuals who have one or more of the following three traits seen as vital for credibly launching such a bid: fame, vast wealth, and elective experience.Oh, and there s one more harbinger: French hasn t actually officially announced his candidacy. So Kristol s only pick might no actually file to run in the first place.Whereas French may be conservative, he is more principled than Trump: while the GOP blowhard has multiple draft deferments and rips off veteran s organizations, French is an Iraq War veteran and a recipient of the Bronze Star.And French, like Kristol, has had a few words to say about Donald Trump. In March, French wrote a blistering critique of the real estate mogul titled  What Now, Conservatives?  likening him to segregationist George Wallace:The party of Lincoln is in ruins. A minority of its primary voters have torched its founders  legacy by voting for a man who combines old-school Democratic ideology, a bizarre form of hyper-violent isolationism, fringe conspiracy theories and serial lies with an enthusiastic flock of online racists to create perhaps the most toxic electoral coalition since George Wallace.How do you know French is a true Republican?

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States sent four detainees from the Guantanamo Bay military prison to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia on Thursday, marking President Barack Obama’s final prisoner transfers from a facility whose continued existence he said would be judged harshly by history. With Republican Donald Trump to be sworn in as president on Friday and vowing to keep the prison open, Democrat Obama whittled down the inmate population there to only 41, far short of fulfilling his promise to close the jail dating back to his 2008 presidential campaign. In a parting shot on an issue seen tarnishing his legacy, Obama said U.S. lawmakers who have thwarted his efforts to shut the prison at the U.S. naval base in Cuba “have abdicated their responsibility to the American people.” “History will cast a harsh judgment on this aspect of our fight against terrorism and those of us who fail to bring it to a responsible end,” he said in a letter to the Republican-controlled Congress. “Once again, I encourage the Congress to close the facility.” Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said: “We are extremely concerned that President-elect Trump will make good on his threat to subject more people to indefinite detention without charge or trial.” The offshore prison was opened by Obama’s predecessor George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects rounded up overseas after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Under Bush, it came to symbolize harsh detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture. The latest transfers included three detainees sent to the UAE, including the last Russian held at the prison, and an Afghan and a Yemeni, U.S. officials said. A Saudi prisoner was sent home. It marked the completion of Obama’s final flurry of releases. Trump said during the election campaign that he not only wants to keep the prison open but “load it up with some bad dudes.” Obama pressed ahead, however, moving out most of the prisoners on a list of low-level detainees deemed by parole-style inter-agency reviews to be safe for transfer. There were 242 prisoners when he took office. His efforts were blocked by mostly Republican opposition in Congress, which barred him from moving prisoners to the U.S. mainland. Pentagon foot-dragging has also been blamed. Obama lamented that his opponents had “placed politics above the ongoing costs to taxpayers, our relationships with our allies and the threat posed to U.S. national security.” Trump said this month that all those held at Guantanamo should stay. “These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield,” he tweeted. However, the Obama administration has insisted that intelligence shows only a very small percentage of the prisoners it has released have returned to militant activities. Among the three sent to the UAE was Ravil Mingazov, reported to be an ethnic Tatar and Russian army veteran captured in Pakistan in 2002. Also sent to UAE were Haji Wali Muhammed and Yassim Qasim Mohammed Ismail Qasim, while Jabran al Qahtani was flown to Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon said. Of the prisoners left at Guantanamo, 10 face charges in military commissions, including people accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks. About two dozen have not been charged but have been deemed too dangerous to release. A handful of inmates previously cleared for transfer will remain after the administration was unable to make arrangements in time for relocation. Lawyers for two of those detainees, an Algerian and a Moroccan, mounted last-ditch court challenges seeking their repatriation but the Justice Department objected.

0,WELFake Dataset,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has requested that a trial over a lawsuit by former students of his now-defunct Trump University be put on hold until after the presidential inauguration, according to a motion filed by his lawyer late Saturday. A trial in federal court in San Diego over former Trump University students’ claims that they were defrauded by a series of real-estate seminars is scheduled to begin on Nov. 28, but Trump lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said the president-elect needs to “devote all of his time and attention to the transition process.” Trump is due to assume office on Jan. 20, 2017.  “The 69 days until inauguration are critical and all-consuming,” Petrocelli said in the filing, arguing that the president-elect should not be required to stand trial during that time. Petrocelli had said at a hearing in San Diego on Thursday that he would request the delay, though U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing the lawsuit, told lawyers he was not inclined to put off the six-year-old case further and encouraged the parties to settle. The lawsuit involves students who claim they were lured by false promises to pay up to $35,000 to learn Trump’s real estate investing “secrets” from his “hand-picked” instructors. Trump owned 92 percent of Trump University and had control over all major decisions, the students’ court papers say. The president-elect denies the allegations and has argued that he relied on others to manage the business.  Curiel also tentatively rejected last week a bid by the president-elect to keep a wide range of statements from the presidential campaign, which included attacks against Curiel himself, out of the fraud trial.  Trump attacked the judge as biased against him. He claimed Curiel, who was born in Indiana but is of Mexican descent, could not be impartial because of Trump’s election campaign pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico.  Trump’s lawyers have argued that Curiel should bar from the trial accusations about Trump’s personal conduct including alleged sexual misconduct, his taxes and corporate bankruptcies, along with speeches and tweets. Curiel is presiding over two cases against Trump and the university. A separate lawsuit by New York’s attorney general is pending. While presidents enjoy immunity from lawsuits arising from their official duties, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that this shield does not extend to acts alleged to have taken place prior to taking office.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Every day, the NFL gives fans another reason to stop supporting them. Although the NFL agreed to refund a small portion of the money our Defense Department (US taxpayers) have paid them to show support for our military, it s the idea that Americans have been duped into believing it was something they did out of honor or reverence for our military. The NFL has reached a new low with their acceptance of players who are disrespecting our flag to promote Obama s race war while disallowing the Dallas Cowboys to honor the 5 police officers slain in their hometown by a Black Lives Matter terrorist. Don t forget, they also looked away when Cleveland Brown s player, Isaiah Crowell posted an Instagram picture of a cop with his neck being slit open. The NFL never said a word. They never even acknowledged what some considered to be a terrorist type threat to our law enforcement.In May 2016, the NFL announced that they would return more than $700,000 of taxpayers  money that was paid to teams for sponsored military tributes.After being criticized for  paid patriotism,  in which money came out of the armed forces budget for various measures of public recognition during games, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said that the league would pay that money back.In a letter written to Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain on Wednesday, and disclosed on Thursday, Goodell said that   following an audited review of 100 marketing agreements from 2012 to 2015 by accounting firm Deloitte & Touche   teams were deemed to have received $723,734 for acts of sponsored patriotism. Given the immense sacrifices made by our service members, it seems more appropriate that any organization with a genuine interest in honoring them, and deriving public credit as a result, should do so at its own expense and not at that of the American taxpayer,  the report said.  Americans deserve the ability to assume that tributes for our men and women in military uniform are genuine displays of national pride, which many are, rather than taxpayer-funded DOD marketing gimmicks.   PGLast year, Flake and McCain disclosed that the U.S. Department of Defense had spent $5.4 million in contracts with 14 NFL teams from 2011 to 2014. Some of those contracts disclosed that payment was for on-field flag ceremonies and tributes to welcome home veterans. One team, the Atlanta Falcons, had made more than $1 million from the department over those four seasons.The National Guard spent $6.7 million on contracts with NFL teams from 2013 to 2015.

The Pew Research Center released a report last week based on information from the National Center for Health Statistics on birth rates in the United States. Data found within the report could raise concerns over both the economic and cultural ramifications of the birth rates of foreign-born mothers in the United States. 
According to the report, ""In 2014, about 275,000 babies were born to unauthorized-immigrant parents in the United States, accounting for about seven percent of all U.S. births, and 32 percent of all U.S. births to foreign-born mothers."" 
While that figure represents a decline in the number of babies born to unauthorized immigrants in the United States, the economic impact of these children is significant, as illegal families are granted access to welfare programs through their U.S.-born children, known as “anchor babies.” 
Last year, in an analysis of 2009 census data, National Review reported that 71 percent of illegal-alien-headed households with children received some sort of welfare, compared with 39 percent of native-headed households. Furthermore, children of illegals are granted access to public schools, which can cost approximately $160,000 per pupil for a K-12 public school education, based on an average yearly cost of $12,300 per student. 
These 275,000 children are also granted access to healthcare. Under ObamaCare, these families are eligible for costly subsidies paid for by taxpayers who, in many cases, are not eligible for the same subsidies and therefore are faced with either exorbitant healthcare costs for their own families or stiff fines for opting out of health insurance. 
Furthermore, the data also reveal that foreign-born mothers live in families that make less money than U.S.-born counterparts. Pew Research writes, “While median family income for new U.S-born moms is about $51,200 annually, this figure is $41,300 for new foreign-born moms. And while about 26% of new U.S.-born mothers live in poverty, this share rises to 31% for foreign-born new mothers.” 
Pew advises, “The share of babies born to moms from Latin America has declined while the share of babies born to moms from regions such as Asia has increased."" 
It’s also worth noting that when these babies become adults, they will compete for wages against the children of U.S.-born parents in a slow-growing economy weighed down by crippling regulations. 
Pew reports, “While the annual number of babies born in the U.S. has fluctuated in recent years — most markedly during the Great Recession when there was a significant drop in births nationwide — the trajectory over the past four decades or so has been upward. In 2014, there were 4.00 million births in the U.S., compared with 3.74 million in 1970.” 
The report continues, “This growth has been driven entirely by the increasing numbers of babies born to immigrant women. In 2014, immigrant women accounted for about 901,000 U.S. births, which marked a threefold increase from 1970 when immigrant women accounted for about 274,000 births. Meanwhile, the annual number of births to U.S.-born women dropped by 11% during that same time period, from 3.46 million in 1970 to 3.10 million in 2014."" 
The International Business Times reports that by 2042, minorities will become the majority and by 2050, will make up 54 percent of the populace. By 2023, non-whites will be the majority among children. 
The impact on the cultural makeup of the United States is troubling, as it remains to be seen whether these families will assimilate into the American culture. In a piece for The New American last week, Thomas Sowell wrote, People who came here a hundred years ago usually did so in order to fit within the framework of America and become Americans. Some still do. But many come from a very different cultural background — and our own multiculturalism dogmas and grievance industry work to keep them foreign and resentful of Americans who have achieved more than they have. Some immigrant groups seek to bring to America the very cultures whose failures led them to flee to this country. Not all individual immigrants and not all immigrant groups. But too many Americans have become so gullible that they are afraid to even get the facts about which immigrants have done well and improved America, and which have become a burden that can drag us all down. 
One need not look further than California to find evidence of Sowell’s observations. At Live Oak High School in Morgan Hill, for example, American flag t-shirts were banned during Cinco de Mayo (May 5), a Mexican holiday, so as to not offend the Mexican students. 
As noted by Mike Gonzalez, senior fellow at the Kathryn and Shelby Collom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, American has drifted far from its belief in “E Pluribus Unum” (Latin for “Out of Many, One”), and has made any expectation for assimilation into American culture a taboo and politically incorrect goal: Patriotic assimilation is the bond that allows America to be a nation of immigrants. Without it, America either ceases to be a nation, becoming instead a hodgepodge of groups — or it becomes a nation that can no longer welcome immigrants. It cannot be both a unified nation and a place that welcomes immigrants without patriotic assimilation. Over the past few decades, however, America has drifted away from assimilating immigrants. Elites — in the government, the culture, and the academy — have led a push toward multiculturalism, which emphasizes group differences. This transformation has taken place with little input from rank-and-file Americans, who overwhelmingly support assimilation. As Ronald Reagan worried just as it was first getting underway, this tectonic shift that “divides us into minority groups” was initiated by political opportunists “to create voting blocs.” 
With foreign-born mothers having more children than U.S.-born mothers, the best hope to preserve the American culture is for these families to adapt to the American culture. 
Meanwhile, the data reveal that an increasing number of children are being born to unmarried parents. The latest figures show that 42 percent of U.S.-born women were unmarried when giving birth. 
The Pew Research Center reports, The share of babies born to unmarried mothers has consistently been higher for U.S.-born women than for immigrant women. However, the roughly 10-point gap between the two groups in 2014 is the largest disparity since birth data by nativity and marital status became available 30 years earlier. 
Overall, 41 percent of babies born in 2014 were to unmarried women — double what it was 30 years ago. Teenagers comprise six percent of the births among unmarried U.S.-born women and two percent of foreign-born women.  ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"We recently moved from NYC to Portland, Oregon, and I have to say the biggest change (besides all of the trees and so much more living space!) is the cycling culture. Portland is one of the most bike-friendly cities in the country. There are bikes everywhere you look (I just bought this one and I love it). Not only are there safe bike lanes leading everywhere—including all the way to the airport—there’s also a bike shop on every corner and even a bike assembly area within the airport terminal itself. The bike culture also flourishes in Portland because cyclists and drivers both follow the rules (and, let me tell you, that’s a HUGE change from NYC as well).
Cycling is great for your body and great for the environment. People who ride their bicycles regularly have better cardiovascular fitness, less body fat, increased energy, and they experience less depression. These are all ideal characteristics for being conditioned in a SHTF situation. Cycling to work instead of driving saves close to 10% of your household emissions and biking combats noise pollution, traffic, and uses far less rubber than what is needed for car tires. It makes sense that anyone who is interested in having a sustainable lifestyle would also be interested in traveling by bicycle as much as they can.
Why Cycling Matters in a SHTF Situation 
In addition to health benefits, knowing how to cycle and having the necessary gear can come in handy in a dire SHTF situation. I recently read an article about how traveling by bike is your best bet for surviving the zombie apocalypse—the article was a bit of a joke, but it got me thinking seriously about bugging out and how to travel safely in a potentially dangerous situation.
Riding a Bicycle Lets You Avoid Traffic : First of all, anytime there is an emergency, from a severe weather event to a terrorist threat to a fire, traffic becomes an immense and literal roadblock . You won’t be limited to roads at all if you have a bicycle. Being able to take alternate routes means getting the heck out of Dodge faster—of course, you’ll have issues with covering long distances, but people stuck in hours of traffic will too.
Riding a Bicycle Does Not Require Fuel : There’s also the issue of getting gas and maintaining your energy source for your car. Sure, if you’re prepared, you’ll have a few extra tanks on hand, but what happens when that dries up? In a national or worldwide SHTF situation, gasoline will be among the first resources to go scarce. When the gas is gone, even if drivers are able to power through traffic and use their preps, it’s only a matter of time before they have to abandon their cars and continue their travels on foot.
Bikes are Easy to Repair : A bicycle is a straightforward machine that requires only a slight bit of research to repair. You don’t want to be worrying about your engine or oil changes when you’re on the run.
You Can Still Carry Cargo : If you’ve traveled to Indonesian countries you’ve seen how much gear (or how many people!) can be packed onto a single bicycle. Having a basket or rack is an easy and affordable way to make your bike more emergency friendly. Even just having a simple set up for your bug-out bag and some of your preps will make a huge difference.
You Can Accommodate Children on a Bicycle : If forced to abandon your car, having smaller children means that they slow you down, and if they aren’t willing to walk you will find yourself in a terrible situation indeed. Carriers or trailers like this one mean your child can be sleeping soundly while you travel.
Riding a Bike is Better for Your OPSEC Situation : Bicycles are stealth and silent when you are riding them and are reliable in an off-grid situation . They are small and easy to camouflage–they can even be pulled up into a tree or stashed behind some bushes at a moment’s notice.
At the very least, understand that you cannot rely on your vehicle in a true SHTF situation if you have to flee your home. Loading up your trunk with preps could potentially be a waste of time—instead, you might do well to learn how to ride a bike and be sure one is packed in that trunk of yours.

0,WELFake Dataset,"SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump s speech to the United Nations, where he warned he would  totally destroy  North Korea if threatened, reinforced the need for Pyongyang to realize it must give up its nuclear weapons, South Korea said on Wednesday. In a hard-edged speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, Trump mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a  rocket man  for his repeated ballistic missile tests.  We view the speech as portraying a firm and specific stance on the key issues regarding keeping peace and safety that the international community and the United Nations are faced with,  the office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in a statement on Wednesday.  It clearly showed how seriously the United States government views North Korea s nuclear program as the president spent an unusual amount of time discussing the issue,  the presidential Blue House s statement said. Trump s speech  reaffirmed that North Korea should be made to realize denuclearization is the only way to the future through utmost sanctions and pressure , it said. Moon came to power in May on a platform of more engagement with North Korea. Since Pyongyang s sixth and largest nuclear test earlier on Sept. 3, however, Moon has said the time is not right for dialogue. He and Trump plan to meet in New York early on Wednesday U.S. time, Moon s office said. Trump s most direct military threat to attack North Korea was his latest expression of concern about Pyongyang s repeated weapons tests.  The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea,  Trump told the 193-member world body.  Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and his regime.  U.S. ally Japan, which Pyongyang often threatens to destroy, has taken a consistently hard line on North Korea, pushing for increased sanctions and pressure.   We greatly appreciate President Trump s approach to changing North Korea s policy stance, denuclearizing the country and calling on the international community, including China and Russia, for their cooperation toward strengthening pressure on North Korea,  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters. Suga also welcomed Trump s reference to a Japanese girl who was kidnapped by North Korean agents in 1977. The plight of abductees is a key issue for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has pledged to rescue them while in office, and an emotive one for the Japanese public. North Korea admitted in 2002 it had kidnapped 13 Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s to train spies. Five of them returned to Japan but Tokyo suspects that hundreds more may have been taken.  North Korea, which has conducted more than 80 missile tests under third-generation leader Kim, says it needs its weapons to protect itself from U.S. aggression. South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis told an Air Force event on Wednesday that the effort to deal with Pyongyang was still diplomatically-led even as he acknowledged the  somber reality  that the Pentagon needed to have military options at the ready. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, speaking to CBS News, said on Wednesday the United States had lots of military options on North Korea that stop short of totally destroying the country, adding:  There are steps that lead up to that.   No one wants war, the president doesn t want war. We have tried to do this through dialogue, we have tried to do this through sanctions, we have tried every diplomatic measure that we possibly can. We re not giving up on diplomatic efforts,  she said.  The U.N. Security Council has unanimously imposed nine rounds of sanctions on North Korea since 2006, the latest earlier this month aimed at restricting fuel supplies and cutting off textile exports, a key foreign exchange earner. The United States has urged China, North Korea s main ally and trading partner, and Russia to do more to rein in Kim, something Trump appeared to allude to in his speech.  It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime but would arm, supply and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict,  Trump told the General Assembly. China s Foreign Ministry, asked to respond to Trump s comments about destroying North Korea if it had to, said U.N. resolutions were clear the Korean peninsula issue should be resolved peacefully through political and diplomatic means. The resolutions passed by the U.N. Security Council on North Korea reflected the  common will and consensus of the international community  to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular briefing.

Also unlike Trump, Gates made his money by selling actual products to people and not on the sort of smoke-and-mirrors flim flam that is currently being exposed at Trump University.At a recent event, the topic of Trump s claim that he donated to veteran s charities came up, and Gates   who heads one of the largest charities in the world   made a dig at the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.Gates took the jab at Trump during an interview alongside his wife, Melinda, at a panel discussion hosted by the news outlet ReCode. He hasn t been known for his philanthropy. He s been known for other things,  Gates said to laughter, when asked if the presumptive GOP presidential nominee had been approached to sign a pledge to give away at least half of his wealth to philanthropic causes.Trump was shown to only cut checks to veteran groups after the Washington Post asked him to back up his boasting about donating $6 million months ago on the same day he boycotted a Fox News debate, arguing that moderator Megyn Kelly had been mean to him.By comparison the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation already has $44 billion at its disposal, thanks to the couple parting with some of the money generated from Microsoft. It has made major investments around the world in education, health, and more.Gates and his wife Melinda are also part of a group of the super-rich who have signed  The Giving Pledge  in which they promise to give more than half of their wealth to charity during their lifetimes, or in their wills.

0,WELFake Dataset,"I’m not part of Disney’s target audience for its latest princess movie, “Moana,” but I don’t care. I’ve been excited about this film since Dwayne Johnson previewed it last year at the D23 Expo for all things Disney. As much as the new   Miranda music sounds promising, what’s really exciting is the chance to see a Disney princess who doesn’t look like those we have already. I was already aging out of the children’s movie demographic when my mom took us to see Robert Rodriguez’s “Spy Kids” in 2001. Yes, it was a silly story: Children turn into spies to save their   agent parents. But my sister and I became obsessed. The suave   father was played by Antonio Banderas with a pronounced Spanish accent. The children were named Carmen and Juni (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara) and the implication was that they were   or   Americans. As a daughter of Cuban immigrants who once struggled with her accent, I had never seen characters who looked or sounded like us as the heroes of their own story. “Spy Kids” is still one of the few positive examples I hold onto, 15 years later. I’m not alone. There are many nonwhite women and girls who don’t see movie characters who look the way they do, and the omission can affect their  . That’s why the issue of diversity in movies for young people is just as important as pushing for inclusion across Hollywood, both behind, and in front of, the camera. So much of nonwhite representation in cinema is trivial at best, stereotypical at worst  —   the wisecracking sidekick or the background player stuck there as a token. I remembered feeling that something was amiss about Tito the Chihuahua in Disney’s “Oliver   Company” (1988). Why did the only dog with a Mexican accent (voiced by Cheech Marin, who has a less embarrassing part in “Spy Kids”) have to   cars? I wanted to see more of the mechanic tomboy Audrey Ramirez (Jacqueline Obradors) in “Atlantis: The Lost Empire” (2001) and wished I could forget that “Cars” (2006) has a barely visible lowrider named Ramone (Mr. Marin, again) that happens to be the only vehicle in Radiator Springs with hydraulics. I forgot that “The Emperor’s New Groove” (2000) was set in the Inca Empire, because none of the main voice actors (David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton) sounded as if they spoke our language. Yet one of the   videos in our home was “The Three Caballeros,” a Disney animated guide to South America from 1944. Donald Duck is the American protagonist, joined by the Mexican rooster Panchito (Joaquin Garay) and the Brazilian parrot José (José Oliveira) on a   tour of Latin America. More than just a Technicolor spectacle (akin to “Fantasia,” in terms of trippy animated musical sequences) “The Three Caballeros” was a cultural explainer that didn’t entirely reduce our stories to cheap tropes. As an indirect product of the Good Neighbor Policy, by which the United States invested in South American ties, the movie had incentive to avoid negative portrayals. When it came to Disney princess movies, my sister and I had very different experiences. It was always easier to find a princess who looked the way I do, because I was born with much paler skin than anyone in our family. My younger sister, Cristina, didn’t decide to be Jasmine from “Aladdin” during playtime friends assigned her the character. Back then, that was the animated figure that looked closest to her, and she didn’t have many others to choose from. Luckily, the Disney renaissance of the 1990s gave us many more diverse heroines to treasure. Cristina adored Pocahontas’s free spirit and modeled herself on the strong Mulan. But they often weren’t the main princesses featured in Disney advertising or merchandise. And once their movies faded from store shelves, so would the dolls and the rest of their products. In those days, the newer princesses weren’t stocked   like those of the classic era: Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora from “Sleeping Beauty. ” In this sense, “Moana” is another step in the right direction. Native Hawaiians are entering a rarefied pop culture circle, inclusion in a movie that will reach viewers around the world. Considering how women, and especially women of color, are rarely shown as leaders onscreen, this is no small victory. The evolving arc of Disney princesses  —   from the damsel in distress Snow White in 1937 to the entrepreneurial dreamer Tiana in “The Princess and the Frog” in 2009  —   gives hope that we’ll see more animated stories starring young female characters who look as if they could be from anywhere around the world. Then again, no tickets have been sold to a Disney movie starring a Latina princess. She doesn’t exist yet. The company started a TV show, “Elena of Avalor,” about such a character, but that series lacks the production values and marketing heft of a   movie. It seems like a halfhearted concession to Latinas  —   half a Disney princess  —   but it’s more than other girls still waiting to see themselves on the big screen have received. There are many still waiting for a “Moana” to call their own, a movie to pass on to their children that speaks to them about their culture. My sister ended up working for a few months this year as a performer at one of Disney’s theme parks. After several frustrating auditions, she was told she was too dark to play any character not covered in fur. She tried out to greet guests as Elena of Avalor, and she received the same answer: too dark. (She ended up playing characters while fully covered in costumes.) Not even as an adult does she fit in Disney’s kingdom. But I’m hoping that those days are numbered, and that she and other women and girls like her will never have to feel as if they didn’t belong in the Happiest Place on Earth.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"MYRTLE BEACH, South Carolina (Reuters) - The Vatican on Friday tried to tamp down a firestorm ignited by Pope Francis’ comments assailing Donald Trump’s views on U.S. immigration as “not Christian”, assuring the Republican presidential front-runner that it was not a personal attack or attempt to influence the U.S. campaign. Francis told reporters during a conversation on his flight home from Mexico on Thursday, “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.” Trump has said if elected president, he would build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to keep immigrants from illegally entering the United States.  Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi told Vatican Radio the pope’s comments, in response to a reporter’s question on Trump, were an affirmation of his longstanding belief that migrants should be helped and not shut out. He said the pope believed people “should build bridges, not walls”. “In no way was this a personal attack, nor an indication of how to vote,” Lombardi said.  Trump, who leads Republican candidates in opinion polls, lashed out on Thursday, dismissing the pope’s remarks as “disgraceful” for questioning his faith. “If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS (Islamic State), which as everyone knows is ISIS’ ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president,” Trump said. Later, during a television appearance, he rowed back, calling Francis “a wonderful guy.” The extraordinary exchange between the billionaire real estate developer and leader of the world’s 1.25 billion Roman Catholics, which occurred days before Saturday’s Republican nominating contest in South Carolina, was headline news around the world. On Friday, New York’s Daily News gave it the front page. Against a backdrop of an image of Trump, a headline blared: Anti Christ! The New York Post ran a front page photo of Trump and the pope wearing boxing gloves with the headline: Trump & pope: Bible belters.      It was unclear what, if any, effect the tussle might have on the vote in South Carolina, a conservative state that is home to many evangelical Protestant Christians. Patrick Hornbeck, chairman of the department of theology at Fordham University in New York, said on Thursday that Francis’ words were not surprising given the poverty he had just seen in Mexico. “There is very little common ground between Pope Francis and Donald Trump,” Hornbeck said. He predicted the pope’s words on electoral politics would have little effect on any U.S. Catholics who liked Trump as a candidate. At a CNN town hall in Columbia, South Carolina, on Thursday night, Trump said he had “a lot of respect” for Francis but that the pope had been influenced by hearing only Mexico’s side of the border issue. The pope’s statement also had been exaggerated by the media, he said. “I think he said something much softer than it was originally reported by the media,” Trump said.  Earlier on Thursday, Thomas Groome, director of the Boston College Center on the Church in the 21st Century, said Francis’ comments were entirely in keeping with his focus on mercy. “The pope is commissioned to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. That’s his job,” Groome said. “So when he was asked a direct question, he gave Trump the benefit of the doubt, he said we have to be sure he said this, but if he said this, it is not Christian.”  (Reporting by Emily Flitter; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Toni Reinhold) This article was funded in part by SAP.

One already resigned. Another said he won t vote as his state did. And electors in three states went to court seeking authority to vote as they please.Hillary Clinton s victory in the popular   but not the electoral   vote and uncertainty about Donald Trump have generated unusual interest in an event that is usually a political footnote.Members of the Electoral College will cast their historic votes for the next president of the United States on Monday. In the meantime, they are under siege.The nation s 538 presidential electors have been thrust into the political foreground like never before in American history. In the aftermath of a uniquely polarizing presidential contest, the once-anonymous electors are squarely in the spotlight, targeted by death threats, harassing phone calls and reams of hate mail. One Texas Republican elector said he s been bombarded with more than 200,000 emails. I never can imagine harassing people like this. It s just f  up,  said Jim Rhoades, a Republican elector from Michigan who runs a home inspection service.  I ve lost a bunch of business. In recent decades, the Electoral College had become such a reliable rubber stamp of Election Day results that it was viewed as an afterthought.But with many Democrats desperate to block the all-but-certain ascension of Donald Trump to the White House, this long-neglected body has been gripped by turmoil, and its members have been subjected to pleas to upend centuries of tradition by casting their votes for someone other than the president-elect.There have been ad campaigns targeting electors and op-eds assailing their role. One Democratic member of Congress has called to delay the vote for president while an investigation of Russian involvement in the election is underway. Two others have pleaded with electors to consider Russia s role when deciding how to vote. Progressive groups are preparing protests across the country at sites where electors will meet to cast their ballots. Personal contact information for many electors has been posted publicly   and it s been used to bury them with massive email campaigns.Chris Suprun of Texas, the only GOP elector to publicly oppose Trump, has been especially battered by criticism   mainly from fellow Republicans, including party leaders who have questioned his integrity.Here is Tucker Carlson embarrassing Chris Suprun, as he attempts to explain why he won t vote for Trump: https://youtu.be/7oOhwHG2Gb4Suprun announced his intention to vote for someone other than Trump in a New York Times op-ed, recalling his service on Sept. 11, 2001, as a first responder to the attack on the Pentagon. On Friday, a Texas television station ran a story accusing Suprun of inventing his 9/11 role, the story that Suprun built his career around. The charge, based on a discrepancy with Suprun s LinkedIn page, featured an anonymous former colleague accusing Suprun of  stolen valor.   PoliticoEarlier this year, former deputy White House chief of staff Roy Neel published a whimsical piece of political fiction about  faithless electors  changing a presidential election outcome. In The Electors, an incumbent Republican president loses the popular vote and falls three electors short in the Electoral College as well. His devilish chief of staff hatches a plot that succeeds in turning two  faithless electors  against the Democratic candidate they were pledged   but not required by law   to support. Because a third turncoat has a massive heart attack before her vote is technically cast, the election goes to the House and the incumbent prevails.I have seen no particular evidence that the shadowy anti-Trump group trying to overturn the 2016 election with Electoral College defections was inspired by Neel s book. But it is so wildly unrealistic and potentially counterproductive that by comparison The Electors is a work of gritty realism.Technically, there are 21 states with 236 electoral votes (135 of them won by Trump) where laws do not require electors to vote for the popular-vote winner in that state. It is also theoretically possible that lawsuits being filed to strike down the coercive laws in the other 29 states (plus the District of Columbia) that sanction  faithless electors  could succeed, though there is no way they could succeed before the Electoral College casts its votes on December 19.The bigger problem is that interest in denying Trump the presidency through a campus riot in the Electoral College is pretty much limited to Democrats.The idea of Republican electors turning against Donald Trump found some traction back in the days when the mogul had nailed down the Republican presidential nomination over the violent objections of much of the GOP. It was the general-election equivalent of all the ultimately vain talk about a revolt of pledged Republican convention delegates determined to keep the demagogue away from the White House. Two Republican electors, one from Georgia and another from Texas, publicly expressed doubts they could bring themselves to cast votes for Trump (two Democratic electors expressed similar reluctance to vote for Hillary Clinton).Two things changed radically to re-consign the  faithless elector  scenario to the pages of fiction. First, of course, Donald Trump did not win the Electoral College vote by the two or three votes that might have made a very small group of renegades potential coup-makers. It would now take a defection of 37 electors to undo the deed of November 8. Beyond that, the Republican Party is no longer in open or even covert revolt against Donald Trump. In a process that began the moment he won the presidential nomination, the GOP has dutifully lined up in support of its president-elect. An awful lot of the anti-Trump sentiment Republicans exhibited earlier this year involved fears that he would lose badly and drag down the Republican-controlled Congress with him. Those fears are obviously moot today. No Republicans in Washington or in the states will offer cover to a faithless elector, much less 37 of them. It is so not happening.And so the plea made most conspicuously by Harvard law professor and political busybody Lawrence Lessig, that Republican electors rear up on their constitutional hind legs and award the presidency to Hillary Clinton as the popular vote winner, does not even pass the laugh test. Other members of the putsch cabal depart from Lessig by promoting a scenario whereby Trump-hating Republicans and Clinton-hating Democrats could join hands to elect somebody else entirely.And even if the moon turned blue and somehow a coup did happen, there is a fail-safe opportunity for Republicans when Congress meets to count and certify the Electoral College vote. Congress could choose to disregard the actions of  faithless electors  (with support from GOP officials in the affected states) and certify Trump as the winner. And if (and we are deep into science fiction at this point) the Electoral College does not clearly award anyone with 270 electoral votes, then the House would name Donald Trump president anyway.

0,WELFake Dataset," (This Oct. 18 story corrects age in paragraph 19 to five, not six) By Tom Bergin LONDON (Reuters) - The bill for compensating families of those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire in London may be as low as 4 million pounds ($5 million), according to several lawyers and a Reuters analysis of how damages laws apply in England. The blaze engulfed a 24-storey social housing block in west London on June 14, killing an estimated 80 people in the country s deadliest fire since World War Two. While similar disasters in the United States have led to massive payouts, any compensation for Grenfell would be far lower because English laws offer less generous damages and don t allow punitive claims, even if companies are found criminally responsible, said Brett Dixon, president of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL). The four main firms that have been linked to the Grenfell fire - U.S. companies Arconic Inc. and Whirlpool Corp. and Britain s Harley Facades and Rydon Group - declined to comment on the size or calculation of potential payouts. The Reuters calculation of a bill of 4 million pounds is based on the compensation amounts stipulated in the Fatal Accidents Act of 1976, precedents set in previous cases and the individual circumstances of the 70 victims identified so far. Three personal injury lawyers have verified the methodology used by Reuters and said the estimate for the total payout is reasonable. If the courts find there was no unlawful behavior by any of the companies or public bodies involved, victims will not be entitled to sue for compensation and would only get the financial support and temporary housing already provided by the government and public donations, personal injury lawyers said.  The British judicial system is not renowned for being generous,  said Rebecca Thomas of law firm Duncan Lewis, which is representing some victims  families.  It s not about money for the families,  said Tim Murphy, whose brother Denis, a disabled former painter who lived on the 14th floor, died in the fire.  Nothing can ease our pain, (but) I think it s quite insulting.  The U.S. legal system sees punitive damages as a way of encouraging companies to behave lawfully, but British and European governments have taken the view this approach would put excessive burdens on the judicial system, businesses, insurers and state bodies that might be liable, some legal experts say. While APIL said the Grenfell Tower disaster demonstrated the inadequacy of payouts to victims, Duncan Fairgrieve, who has advised the UK government on compensation rules, said more generous payouts could also harm society. They could drive up insurance costs for all and lead to big claims against government bodies such as the National Health Service and the police, he said.  There is an affordability issue,  said Fairgrieve, a Senior Research Fellow at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. If the courts find someone was wrongfully killed, the claim categories are a flat 12,980 pounds per victim for bereavement, costs such as funeral bills, dependency damages where minors or dependent spouses are left behind, and property damage - all to be paid by the party found responsible. Under the 1976 law, only family members who were supported by those who died can claim dependency damages. Reuters has identified only five people who died leaving dependents who could definitely claim damages - on the basis they were financially dependent on the deceased. Daniel Machover, a lawyer at Hickman and Rose, which is representing some victims  families, also said he didn t expect there to be many claims. Most of the others who died in the fire were minors, single or elderly and did not leave family members who were financially dependent upon them. The biggest dependency payout will be for children who lost both parents, said lawyers representing some of the victims. One five-year-old girl, Tasnim Belkadi, lost her mother, father and all her siblings in the fire. Lawyers said she could get 300,000 pounds, based on a share of her parents  income and some childcare costs up to her 18th birthday. Her aunt, with whom she now lives, did not respond to requests for comment on the Reuters calculation. Grenfell plaintiffs can also claim expenses they incurred as the result of a death, such as the cost of a modest funeral. Heirs to the deceased could also claim the value of goods lost in the fire. The Association of British Insurers puts the cost of replacing the contents of an average three-bedroom home at 55,000 pounds. However, Thomas said Grenfell claims would probably be less than 30,000 pounds per property because compensation is based on the market value of personal belongings rather than replacement value, and the flats destroyed had only one or two bedrooms. Based on the victims  circumstances, Reuters has calculated the payout for dependency damages could be 1.2 million pounds, for property it could be 1.4 million and for bereavement it could come to 1.0 million. Other smaller claims for costs and loss of parental guidance take the total to 4 million pounds. Police said the fire started in a fridge freezer made by a subsidiary of U.S. company Whirlpool and have been investigating whether the tower s cladding, made by U.S. firm Arconic Inc., played a role in the spread of the blaze. Arconic said it was up to contractors to ensure its products were used correctly. Whirlpool said it was investigating the fire. Rydon Group, the contractor that oversaw the refurbishment when the new cladding was added, said it had complied with all regulations. Sub-contractor Harley Facades Ltd said it was not aware of any link between the fire and the cladding. Fears among investors that companies linked to Grenfell could be sued for large sums in the United States hit their shares. Whirlpool s market value fell about $250 million on June 23 when police identified the maker of the appliance as Hotpoint, a brand owned by Indesit, which is a subsidiary of Whirlpool based in Italy. More than $1 billion was wiped off Arconic Inc. s value after Reuters reported in June that internal emails showed it had supplied flammable cladding panels, knowing they would be used on the tower and despite warning in its brochures that only non-combustible panels should be used on tall buildings. Arconic s share price has recovered since its late June lows but it and Whirlpool s stock are below the levels they were at just before the fire, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 7 percent over the same period. Awards against companies in U.S. courts have run into the tens of millions of dollars per family in some cases. In 1980, a fire blamed in part on inadequate fire safety measures killed 85 people at the MGM Grand Hotel in Nevada and injured hundreds. The hotel operator and contractors agreed to pay victims  families and survivors more than $200 million. Foreigners have often tried to sue U.S. corporations in U.S. courts over alleged wrongdoing abroad. However, judges have consistently ruled they lacked jurisdiction in such cases, saying adequate tribunals existed in the plaintiff s own country and that it would be hard for defendants to make their case in the United States. Machover at Hickman and Rose said he was considering whether Grenfell victims could bring a U.S. case on the basis that two of the companies involved were based there. But Thomas at Duncan Lewis and Leigh Day partner Jill Paterson were skeptical that U.S. courts would agree to hear Grenfell claims given the United Kingdom offers a reasonable forum for redress and because the U.S. companies were involved through European-registered subsidiaries.  I can t see any circumstances under which they could bring this in the United States,  said Thomas. Arconic and Whirlpool declined to comment on the possibility of legal claims against them.

0,WELFake Dataset,"GENEVA (Reuters) - British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Friday he wanted to see much more information about the Brexit divorce deal struck between Prime Minister Theresa May s government and the European Commission. May sealed the deal after a pre-dawn dash to Brussels, thereby clearing the way for the start of arduous talks on future trade ties between Britain and the EU after Brexit. Asked if he thought the deal with the EU was a breakthrough, Corbyn told reporters:  Until I see more of it, no.   Speaking in Geneva after a visit to the United Nations, Corbyn said his party stood ready for another parliamentary election in Britain at any time, noting May s reliance for her majority on Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).  They (the DUP) seem to be calling the shots all the time. They scuppered a deal she was trying to make a few days ago and they clearly put conditions on this, which is why I want to see a much fuller statement than we ve had thus far,  he said. The next election in Britain is not due until 2022, but there has been much media speculation that it could come much earlier due to May s lack of a parliamentary majority and deep divisions within her governing Conservative Party over Brexit. Corbyn said Labour had consistently called for maintaining the benefits of belonging to the EU s customs union and single market during a transitional period as Britain leaves the bloc.  The transitional period is unspecific and I think she needs to bring some clarity to that,  he said. The transition should be long enough to guarantee UK and EU jobs and to deal with common problems, such as regulating airspace, he said. It should also ensure that consumers , workers  and environmental rights were put into British law.   The statements that have been made this morning do not specify what regulatory framework there will be in the future and that remains to be seen, because there are still many people in the Conservative Party who want to live in a de-regulated environment, where Britain basically lowers wages and conditions and the tax take on large corporations.      Corbyn said he hoped Friday s deal included sections on the rights of family reunion for EU and British citizens, adding they should be granted unilaterally and not negotiated. A reference in the deal to involving the European Court of Justice on citizenship issues for up to eight years was a sign that the government accepted the need for judicial oversight of citizens  rights, he said.

Thinking like a failed businessman, he insisted we should simply go to our creditors and ask them to take less. Yes, in one idiotic statement, Donald Trump exposed just how little he knows about the economy or how the debt works. As The Times points out, there is no credible evidence suggesting that our debtors would reduce we owe them by a nickel. Trump thinks he s dealing in people with real estate they can t move selling bad debt for more bad debt until one day so much of the debt is paper   bad paper   that there s nothing left to do but fail. Sound familiar? It should; it s what Wall Street and the Dubya administration did to us in 2008.Let s assume for a moment that our creditors would take less. The bulk of the national debt is money we owe to ourselves. Is Trump going to ask the Social Security trust fund to take pennies on the dollar because we had a couple of wars that were too expensive and some handouts to fix the mess? How much less should those people who won t be able to retire when the fund is wiped out take? They ve been putting 6.2 percent of their paycheck into that fund since they started working. How much less should they settle for?As for our other creditors, We re not defaulting on rented furniture. We owe other countries a great deal of money, plus interest, that they provided to us in cash. We use that money to fund the government. If creditors start seeing those kinds of tactics we ll have our credit rating lowered and lose credibility as a country. There s also a good chance the dollar would be removed as the world standard currency. Ask Donald Trump what he ll do when we can t just print more money.The bottom line is, Trump has no idea what he s talking about. The national debt is one of the most misunderstood components of the federal government. For someone to seek the office that holds much influence over how that debt shrinks or grows without understanding it is preposterous, but then again   we are talking about Donald Trump.Featured image from billingsgazette.com",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"KABUL (Reuters) - Nancy Hatch Dupree, a historian from the United States who helped set up the Afghanistan Centre at Kabul University, has died in the country whose culture she worked for more than five decades to preserve, the university said on Sunday. She was 89. Dupree arrived in Kabul in 1962 as a diplomat s wife but soon divorced and married Louis Dupree, an archaeologist celebrated for his adventurous exploits and groundbreaking discoveries of Paleolithic Afghan tools and artifacts. For the next 15 years, they traveled across Afghanistan by Land Rover as Louis Dupree excavated prehistoric sites and Nancy wrote a series of witty and insightful guidebooks to a country since torn apart by decades of warfare.  She called herself an old monument and a lot of Afghans called her the  Grandmother of Afghanistan,  said Wahid Wafa, Executive Director of the Afghanistan Centre.  She understood and knew Afghanistan much better than anybody else.  A fixture in the social scene of Kabul during the 1970s, a now-vanished world of smart cocktail parties and mini-dresses, they were forced to leave in 1978 after the Soviet-backed government accused Louis Dupree of being a spy. Her husband died in 1989 and much of the time before her return to Afghanistan in 2005 was spent in Pakistan, where as well as briefly meeting Osama Bin Laden and working with the growing number of war refugees, she assiduously gathered as much documentation on Afghanistan as she could. In 2005, after the fall of the Taliban and the installation of a new Western-backed government in Kabul, she returned with some 35,000 documents wrapped up in fertilizer bags, which became the basis for the Afghanistan Centre archive. A prolific writer, she was director of the Centre between 2006 and 2011 and continued to go into her office after she stepped down, remaining an institution in the cultural life of Kabul and receiving a stream of visitors.    It was Nancy s aim to preserve Afghanistan s heritage,  said Wafa.  She was a very funny, interesting person who loved to talk to anyone coming to visit. She was kind, she was very giving with the information she had and she was always lobbying for the Afghanistan she first knew.  While she could be waspishly critical of both blundering Westerners and Afghans she felt were promoting a bigoted version of their culture, she retained her faith in her adopted country to the end, Wafa said.   Despite the 40 years of war in Afghanistan she was always hopeful of the future and hopeful for the future of the new generation in Afghanistan.  ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Can I finally admit that my role model was a sitcom character? Mary Richards  —   played to perfection by the beloved Mary Tyler Moore  —   was more than a role model, she was a template. Even in fashion and home décor  —   my choices mimicked hers. Mary Tyler Moore had shown up just when everything about women’s lives was about to change. Her show debuted in 1970, when I was 19, still in college and not imagining a career in television  —   or a career in anything. But two years after Mary first joyfully threw her tam hat up in the air and joined   in Minneapolis, I began my television career in a city also ending in ’apolis. That part is coincidental, of course  —   but my home? Mary lived in a studio apartment with a pullout sofa bed, and not coincidentally so did I. And if my apartment was not quite so charming, it wasn’t for lack of copying. I didn’t yet have a style of my own, so whenever possible I borrowed Mary’s. A few years later, when to outward appearances, I was making it on my own, I was on the cover of Chicago Tribune magazine holding a   find  —   a large gold number “5”  —   for Channel 5, my new broadcast home. But in truth, the inspiration was Mary. She had a big   “M. ” It was affixed to the wall, part of the furniture, just like her highboy chest of drawers. I also had one of those. In Chicago, I moved up into a   condo in a high rise. Mary had also moved out of her studio and into a condo where she gives herself a housewarming. Her parties  —   this was a running gag  —   were always dull. Sitting alone on the floor after her last guest has left, she surveys her modern new home and says, “I HATE IT. ” I loved her for that. The ’70s were my formative years, and when my career got way out ahead of me, I still had Mary to fill in some gaps. We viewers were never given a peek inside her   closet, but Mary would walk out of it in one cute outfit after another usually a smart knit. I gravitated in that direction, too  —   if not with the same effect. For my farewell show in Chicago, on the eve of my debut on the “Today” show, I chose a knit ensemble in alternating wide stripes of brown, orange and white  —   possibly inspired by the colorations of a clown fish. I was thinking of Mary. Not long after, Tom Brokaw looked at me across the anchor desk one morning and said, “Burn the dress. ” Not Mary’s fault. I’m sometimes described as a “pioneer” in broadcast journalism  —   which is preposterous. The chair I settled into in 1976 had been recently vacated by the real thing, Barbara Walters. Barbara was indisputably the   woman in television news at that time, but she was not the best known or most beloved. That distinction belonged to “Mary. ” “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” started several years before two words, “and women,” were inserted into an F. C. C. affirmative action clause pertaining to television station hiring. That might have helped women like me get a job, but Mary Richards may already have opened as many doors she had made a woman in the newsroom seem normal. Mary was ahead of her time, but not too far. She was not superwoman she was someone you could be. She was someone you wanted to be. Mary was plucky, but not driven. When starting a new life in Minneapolis, she was just looking for a job, not a career. And though uncommonly beautiful, Mary made it O. K. to be dateless on a Saturday night  —   which I often was. (I wasn’t alone. On Saturday nights, as Oprah recalled, she would put the conditioner in her hair during “The Bob Newhart Show” and rinse it out before “Mary. ”) Mary Tyler Moore, was “our Mary. ” She was the right woman at the right time.

In a few days, the ugliest and most distasteful presidential election in US history will be over, and we will see which candidate won to preside over the US as president. This is an election that is all about groping and emails, making us the laughing stock of the world. 
As we all saw in this campaign, there was little of anything about the priorities that really matter to the American people. Both candidates talk about bringing back jobs, industrial and manufacturing jobs. 
We know well that both are liars and will never bring back the kind of industrial and manufacturing jobs that gave middle-class Americans a sense of dignity and security. 
The two candidates did their best to cater to the rich and powerful, the people with the money and the billionaires who always shaped our nation agenda and politics. 
Billions have poured into this year national elections, no different from previous national/presidential elections where close to $5 billion were injected in and invested in the elections. The returns are for the donors never for the voters. 
America’s poor, not only Black and Hispanic but White as well have been neglected for a long time. They are getting the “ shaft” everywhere and from everyone, especially from Congress, that empower corporate America to screw the poor at every turn and in every way. And Congress does that through legislation that gives incentives to corporations to locate their manufacturing jobs overseas, that allows banks and financial institutions especially the credit card companies to give the shaft to the poor. What does the future hold for our next generation? 
It should not be surprising that this great country of ours has such a staggering number of poor — over 45 million or 14.5% of the population — with the prospect that most Americans will be part of this category at least one year, if they are between the age of 24-75 years. 
Not all poor are unemployed living off the system, but there are millions of these poor who are working hard, very hard one or two jobs to make ends meet, with Hispanics and Blacks most likely to be among this category than Asians and Whites; with women more likely than men to fall into this category of working poor; and with White males with less than a high school education spending at least one year in this category. 
It is hard to think, in this country of plentiful that 46.5 million people earn less than $19,090 a year, and 20.4 million are in deep poverty, earning less than $11,510 a year. 
While our presidential candidates cater to the rich and powerful seeking their support, no candidates are talking about the poor-paying jobs that Americans have; with 50% of available jobs paying less than $34,000 annually. Talk about the banks and financial institutions that looted tens of millions from Americans’ pension funds during the financial crisis of 2007-8, or the fact that Congress allowed corporations to restructure, benefiting Wall Street and the investors, while cheating workers out of their pensions and health care. Of course, Republicans talk about eliminating “entitlements” for the poor, while forgetting or neglecting the kind of entitlements the US Military gets, or the kind of entitlements corporations and rich executives get as part of the deal worked out with members of Congress — entitlements that are triple what the hard-working and poor American gets. 
It is true that 27 families out of 100 get cash assistance, but not all of them are Black or Hispanic, as we are lead to believe, thus causing an outcry to end the Welfare system. I should note here that 90% of the entitlements goes to the elderly and the poor and retired workers on social security and Medicare, amounting to $500 billion. 
But then let us look at how the system, which is sponsored and nurtured by Congress screws American every day. 
Let us take, for example, the interest rates charged on credit cards. In most cases, the poor are the ones who gets behind on credit card payments and as such, the interest rates charged is almost twice as much as the average rate and moreover if one gets behind on one payment on one credit cards, all the other credit card companies hike the rate. Thus the poor pay a higher price and costs. 
With high-interest rates charged and the likelihood of default on one payment, then the credit ratings are changed, forcing the poor to pay higher interests on car loans and on mortgage loans. 
What is truly a rip off is the fact that companies like “payday loans” and “car title companies” while considered as banks receiving funds at less than 1% can charge borrowers 30 even 50%? Unconscionable. 
The poor also get the shafts from health care companies especially supplemental insurance. Because of the fact that the poor are most likely to suffer from certain chronic diseases such as obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes, their rates are much higher than the average. 
Add to that the way our schools are funded. Since we do not have a national tax plan that funds education, all the funding comes from property tax. 
As such if you are in a poor neighborhood, the income to support the schools system, the police, and the fire department is much less than in affluent communities and, as such, children get less quality education, and most likely they will be among the poor who will live on government subsidies; and most likely these neighborhoods will have higher crime rates and a higher percentage of incarceration. What the government saves in support of education, it pays double that in the cost of crime and incarceration. This simply makes no sense, as a society. 
I leave you with two incidents that I personally experienced. 
– Supplemental Health Insurance : We, I mean those of us over the age of 65, have and must purchase supplemental health insurance to complement our Medicare. I purchased a policy from UnitedHealth through AARP paying $258 a month. After almost a year, I discovered that the CEO of UnitedHealth earned $60,500,000/year in salary. I made a simple calculation; and it was shocking to realize that I have to pay 19,500 years of monthly premium just to pay his salary for one year. Of course, I dropped UnitedHealth because of this. 
– Exploitation of Disadvantaged Communities : The other when I had my private company, which offered auto dealers a smart loyalty card, where dealers can add to the card special packages, such as oil change, discount on maintenance, and extended warranty, while consumers benefited from being able to keep track of their vehicle service and maintenence records on the smart chip in the card (Patented), thus saving car owners from getting ripped off by duplicate or unwarranted repairs. Many dealers especially those in the poor neighborhoods where charging the poor interest rates exceeding 20% on car loans, and forcing these poor guys to buy additional warranties, and charging them thousands of dollars of services the dealers knew the customers would never need. I had to drop these dealers from my network. 
Who knows, maybe one day, we will have a Congress and presidential candidates who will represent, not only the very rich but the very poor and the middle class, and offer solutions that get the people to work and out of welfare and subsidies. The American people are not lazy, but they need an opportunity; and Trump and Clinton will not bring that opportunity.

0,WELFake Dataset,"PRISTINA (Reuters) - Any move by Kosovo to scrap a war crimes court linked to its independence struggle would seriously undermine relations with friendly western nations, its main backer the United States said on Friday. Lawmakers from the governing coalition, who hold a majority, are pressing for a vote to abolish the court. The vote was scheduled for later in the day but it failed twice due to opposition from other parties. Parliament speaker Kadri Veseli said parliament would continue to attempt to vote on the issue in the coming days. Isa Mustafa, Kosovo s former prime minister and an opposition leader, said the proposal was  devastating for our state and very damaging for justice .  The Specialist Chamber was established in The Hague in 2015 to bring to justice Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) guerrillas alleged to have committed atrocities during the 1998-99 war that led to the country s secession from Serbia. It has yet to hear any cases. Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, President Hashim Thaci and parliamentary speaker Veseli are former KLA commanders. The court s judges and prosecutors are foreign but it has been set up under Kosovan law, giving Pristina jurisdiction over it. Calling for the parliamentary vote to be halted, U.S. ambassador Greg Delawie said it would have  extraordinarily negative implications  for Kosovo.  It is just a disgrace,   he told reporters in Pristina.  This will be considered by the U.S. as stab in the back. Kosovo will be choosing isolation instead of cooperation.  There was no immediate response from Kosovo officials to Delawie s comments. Washington has been Kosovo s leading political and financial backer since it declared independence in 2008. Nataliya Apostolova, the EU representative in Pristina, called the attempt to scrap the court  appalling and extremely damaging .  The court was set up following U.S. and European pressure on the government to confront alleged KLA crimes against ethnic Serbs. According to Kosovo media, the court could indict or call as witnesses some of current government officials. It was set up in the Netherlands to minimize the risk of witness intimidation and judicial corruption. Kosovo s war veterans  association last week launched an initiative to hold a parliamentary debate to abolish the law that established the court. They gathered 15,000 signatures, Kosovo media reported.  NATO air strikes on Serbia forced Belgrade to withdraw its troops from Kosovo in 1999, having killed around 10,000 Albanian civilians. NATO has around 5,000 troops stationed in Kosovo to keep a still fragile peace.     Kosovo, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian and 5 percent Serbian, is recognized by more than 110 mainly by western countries but not by Serbia s key ally Russia or China.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama defended Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Wednesday and criticized the FBI  announcement of new emails linked to her private server, saying there was no room for innuendo in the investigative process. In his first comment since the FBI reported a new cache of emails possibly related to Clinton, Obama said in a radio interview he did not want to meddle in the process.  But his displeasure at how it unfolded was clear. “I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we don’t operate on innuendo and we don’t operate on incomplete information and we don’t operate on leaks. We operate based on concrete decisions that are made,” he told NowThisNews in the interview, which was taped on Tuesday and aired on Wednesday. The FBI said on Friday it had found new emails that might pertain to Clinton’s use of a private server for government business while she was Obama’s first secretary of state from 2009-13. FBI Director James Comey said he did not know whether the emails were significant and released no information other than that they existed. His announcement 11 days before the Nov. 8 election drew outrage from Democrats and others who believed it would unfairly influence the vote. The decision flouted longstanding FBI traditions of keeping investigations confidential and avoiding politically sensitive announcements close to a presidential election.  On Monday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he would “neither defend nor criticize” Comey’s decision. However, he added that the president expected “an adherence to longstanding tradition and practice and norms that limit public discussion” of information gathered in such investigations. Little is known yet about the emails, which were found during an unrelated probe into former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Obama noted that the FBI already has determined that Clinton had not intentionally transmitted classified information over her private email server but had been “extremely careless.””When this was investigated thoroughly the last time, the conclusion of the FBI the conclusion of the Justice Department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was that she had made some mistakes but that there wasn’t anything there that was prosecutable,” Obama said. Obama defended Clinton, whose increasingly confident campaign was blindsided by the FBI announcement, as someone who has always put the American people first. “When she makes a mistake, an honest mistake, it ends up being blown up as if it’s some crazy thing,” he said. “I trust her, I know her. And I wouldn’t be supporting her if I didn’t have absolute confidence in her integrity and her interest in making sure that young people have a better future.” ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

How much more evidence do we need before the Everyday American Queen of the Clinton Crime Syndicate is sent to prison? Judicial Watch today released nearly 70 pages of State Department records that show that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides, Deputy Chiefs of Staff Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan, received and sent classified information on their non-state.gov email accounts. The documents, also available on the State Department website, were obtained in response to a court order from a May 5, 2015, lawsuit filed against the State Department (Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00684)) after it failed to respond to a March 18 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking:All emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013 using a non- state.gov  email address.The new documents show that Hillary Clinton used the clintonemail.com system to ask Huma Abedin (also on a non-state.gov email account) to print two March 2011 emails, which were sent from former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (using the moniker  aclb ) to Jake Sullivan on Sullivan s non-state.gov email account. The Obama State Department redacted the Blair emails under Exemption (b)(1) which allows the withholding of classified material. The material is marked as being classified as  Foreign government information  and  foreign relations or foreign activities of the US, including confidential sources. Another email shows that Clinton wanted to know how meetings in Washington, including a four-hour meeting concerning America s war on Libya, would impact her Hampton vacation. Responding to an email that details the sensitive meetings in DC, Clinton emails Abedin on August 26, 2011,  Ok. What time would I get back to Hamptons?  Again, this email discussion takes place on non-state.gov email accounts.The documents also include advice to Clinton on Libya from Sidney Blumenthal, a Clinton Foundation employee who, according to a Judicial Watch investigative report, also had business interests in Libya. Clinton wanted Blumenthal s March 9, 2011, Libya memo to be printed  without any identifiers. The newly released Abedin emails include a lengthy exchange giving precise details of Clinton s schedule using unsecured government emails. The email from Lona J. Valmoro, former Special Assistant to Secretary of State Clinton, to Abedin and Clinton reveals exact times (including driving times) and locations of all appointments throughout the day. Another itinerary email provides details about a meeting at the United Nations in New York at 3:00 on Tuesday, January 31, 2012, with the precise disclosure,  that would mean wheels up from Andrews at approximately 12:00pm/12:15pm. These emails show that Hillary Clinton isn t the only Obama official who should be worried about being prosecuted for mishandling classified information. Her former top State aides (and current campaign advisers) Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan should be in the dock, as well,  said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.  The Obama State Department has now confirmed that Clinton, Abedin, and Sullivan used unsecured, non-government email accounts to communicate information that should now be withheld from the American people  in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, and properly classified.

0,WELFake Dataset,"posted by Eddie You know the Dakota Access Pipeline protests are working when oil interests start resorting to underhanded tricks to paint water protectors in a negative light. As the fight against the pipeline grows in North Dakota and around the country, dirty tricks are being deployed in an apparent attempt to delegitimize the opposition. Dakota Access Employee Tries to Incite Violence, Sheriff’s Department Makes False Report That He Was Shot by Protesters Mother Jones journalist Wes Enzinna, who was at the protests, says he witnessed a Dakota Access LLC employee try to infiltrate the Dakota Access Pipeline protests: “An armed security agent employed by the company behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline was arrested Thursday after he was caught entering the camp of activists protesting near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in southern North Dakota. After a car chase and a standoff during which he allegedly pointed his assault rifle at a local Sioux teenager, the man, whose ID indicated he was an employee of Dakota Access LLC, was arrested and handed over to the FBI.” According to an official statement from the tribe, the man fired several shots from his gun before being peacefully apprehended by tribal police. Witnesses at the scene say he pointed his gun at several protesters. The man was clearly trying to provoke violence that could later be used to demonize protesters who have so far remained peaceful. The Morton County Sheriff’s Department circulated a false report claiming the man was shot, presumably by protesters. As you can see in the images above, the man was not harmed. The Sheriff’s Department has since retracted that report. Anti-Media ’s attempts to obtain clarifying comments from Morton County Sheriff’s were ignored. 
Fake Internet Trolls Slam Dakota Access Pipeline Protests, Promote Pipeline on Twitter 
With very little organic support for the Dakota Access Pipeline remaining, groups allied with the pipeline builders now seem to be creating paid Internet trolls or bots to slam protesters while praising the pipeline. DESMOG , an environmental blog, conducted an investigation and found what it says are “sock puppet” accounts tied to an oil industry lobby operating on Twitter: “A DeSmog investigation has revealed the possibility that a front group supporting the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) — the Midwest Alliance for Infrastructure Now (MAIN) — may have created fake Twitter profiles, known by some as ‘sock puppets,’ to convey a pro-pipeline message over social media. And MAIN may be employing the PR services of the firm DCI Group, which has connections to the Republican Party, in order to do so. “DeSmog tracked down at least 16 different questionable Twitter accounts which used the #NoDAPL hashtag employed by protesters, in order to claim that opposition to the pipeline kills jobs, that those protesting the pipeline at the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s encampment use violence, and that the pipeline does not pose a risk to water sources or cross over tribal land. “On September 13, people began to suspect these accounts were fake, calling them out on Twitter , and by September 14, most of the accounts no longer existed.” 
With the Dakota Access Pipeline builders resorting to backhanded trickery, it’s clear the tide is turning against the pipeline following law enforcement’s overwhelming militarized crackdown of the protests. source:",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Donald Trump s new adviser on tech matters wants to basically get rid of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which acts as a consumer protection watchdog.On Monday, Trump appointed Mark Jamison as one of two members of his tech policy transition team. Let s take a look at his ideologies. In October, Jamison wrote a blog post explaining that he sees no reason for the FCC to exist. Most of the original motivations for having an FCC have gone away,  Jamison wrote.  Telecommunications network providers and ISPs are rarely, if ever, monopolies. As reported by the Washington Post:Jamison has argued that the FCC could be replaced by a much smaller agency charged with handing out licenses for wireless airwaves   essentially acting as a traffic cop for the spectrum over which cellphone calls, mobile data and TV signals travel.Many of the FCC s existing functions could be farmed out, Jamison wrote in the blog post. Subsidies for phone and Internet service could be handled by state governments, while the Federal Trade Commission could handle consumer complaints and take action against abuses by companies. There are some details that were not addressed in the blog post due to time constraints, Jamison said Tuesday, such as the possible need for new state-level powers to address broadband monopolies.FCC leadership has made it clear that they strongly disagree with Jamison s assessment. Tom Wheeler, the Democratic chairman of the FCC, has said that in much of the country there is a  duopoly  when it comes to internet service providers. This severely limits the options of many consumers.Wheeler has fought against companies who have slowed down internet speeds for users with unlimited plans. He has also taken action against companies who have billed customers for content and services they didn t sign up for. He has implemented rules regarding net neutrality to prohibit anticompetitive behavior. Wheeler also took steps to protect the public by forcing internet providers to follow the same privacy guidelines when handling consumer data as legacy phone companies.Hal Singer, an economist at the George Washington University s Institute for Public Policy, said both Jamison and Jeffrey Eisenach, the other member of Trump s two-man tech transition team,  envision a significantly pared-down agency. In their minds, proponents of regulation must demonstrate a market failure  This is a 180-degree turn from Wheeler s FCC, which began with a presumption that markets failed. Getting rid of the FCC would be disastrous, especially for the internet. Just like every other position Trump has filled in the past two weeks, he has chosen the most heinous choice possible.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Unreal! Mooch gets millions for Pakistani girls? The American taxpayers should be outraged by this! Let Pakistan empower its own people! Michelle Obama has been traveling all over the world with the Let Girls Learn initiative as her pet project. The only thing is that most of the places she s traveled to have a great track record with educating girls. It s just one big around the world vacation for Mooch compliments of the American taxpayer. Judicial Watch s Tom Fitton had this to say about the trip: The Obama family continues to bill the taxpayers for costly tourism jaunts thinly disguised as humanitarian crusades EUROPEAN VACATION: MOOCH RUNS UP A HUGE TAB COMPLIMENTS OF THE TAXPAYERS Could someone please remind this woman that America is BROKE! As public schools around the United States suffer through a perpetual financial crisis, the Obama administration commits a breathtaking $70 million to help educate girls in a terrorist nation known as Al Qaeda headquarters. It s part of the First Lady s initiative (Let Girls Learn) to educate and empower an estimated 62 million girls in third-world countries who are not in school. A noble cause indeed, but it s costing American taxpayers huge sums while kids especially minorities in this country struggle in schools that aren t adequately funded, according to public education advocates.  We know that countries with more girls in secondary school tend to have lower maternal mortality rates, lower infant mortality rates, lower rates of HIV/AIDS, and better child nutrition,  according to the initiative s website.  But too often, a girl who could change her world for the better is locked out of that future by the circumstances of her birth or the customs of her community.  So it s Uncle Sam to the rescue. The government of Pakistan, which is included in the State Department s Country Reports on Terrorism, will get the $70 million to promote education among 200,000 girls and young women age 10-19. The announcement was initially made during a White House event this month with the wife and daughter of Pakistan s Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif. The program will serve as a platform and catalyst for broader political and social commitment to strengthen girls  education and empowerment in Pakistan, according to a government announcement.  Young women in Pakistan face barriers and lack of access to education opportunities from an early age due to poverty, cultural norms, and geographic isolation,  the announcement states. The question remains; should American tax dollars go to this foreign education cause when public schools in this country have been hurting for years? Besides financial troubles, there s an epidemic of low-performing schools and dismal graduation rates around the country, especially in the nation s inner cities. They could probably use a few million to create programs that might help improve academic performance or perhaps empower needy students like the multi-million-dollar allocation is predicted to help empower girls in Pakistan. The public school district in the Obamas  own hometown of Chicago could use some extra cash. By Thanksgiving as many as 5,000 teachers could be laid off unless the 367,499-student district Chicago Public Schools gets a $500 million bailout from the state. A recent editorial in the area s mainstream newspaper says that it  has been a disastrous time for Chicago Public Schools.  The piece is accompanied by an illustration of a yellow school bus with  Corruption & Politics in our Schools  plastered across the side. Districts across the nation are in similar situations. In Detroit, Michigan the public school system has a $515 million debt and among the nation s worst performing students. Read more: Judicial Watch",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   On Snapchat last week, MTV published an article with the headline “Is this the thirstiest person on earth?” The article, which ran on Snapchat’s news service, Discover, appeared with a picture of a   blond woman taking a selfie, even though the piece was about a fully clothed man. Those kinds of risqué and misleading images will now be much less prominent on Discover because early on Monday, Snapchat updated its guidelines for publishers in a way that essentially cleans up what is shown on its news service. The new rules more explicitly restrict publishers from posting questionable pictures on Discover that do not have news or editorial value. Snapchat also clarified guidelines that prevent publishers from including reports or links to outside websites that could be considered fake news, saying that all content must be   and accurate. The changes aim to “empower our editorial partners to do their part to keep Snapchat an informative, factual and safe environment for everyone,” said Rachel Racusen, a spokeswoman for the company. Snapchat said it also planned to give publishers a tool in February that would allow them to   content, or stop minors from seeing some content altogether. The moves  —   which come ahead of an initial public offering expected for this spring by Snapchat’s parent company, Snap  —   underscore how the company is trying to distinguish itself from rival social media services. Facebook and Twitter typically give users, including publications, wide latitude in what they can post, which has led the companies into one controversy after another  —   including criticism over fake news and outrage over harassment and abuse by internet trolls. Snapchat is   acting to limit those problems in a way that is reminiscent of how traditional media companies curate what they show people. “Snapchat thinks about the role that its content plays in the lives of consumers differently,” said Steven Kydd, one of the founders of Tastemade, an online food publication. “This is cable all over again, except for a mobile and global audience. ” Cleaning up what is published on Discover could have many benefits for Snapchat, like helping the service appeal to advertisers, which would not have to worry as much that they would be advertising alongside inappropriate content for Snapchat’s primary audience of teenagers and  . The new rules could also whet investors’ appetites for Snapchat if they help the company avoid the taints of fake news and online abuse that have dogged its rivals. “In this environment, every technology company that touches media is concerned about being vulnerable to connections to fake news and disinformation,” said Joshua Benton, director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. “That’s doubly true for a company planning for an I. P. O. ” Snapchat introduced Discover in January 2015 as a part of its mobile app, where it publishes content from established media brands like CNN and Cosmopolitan, as well as newer outlets like the political channel We the People. For Snapchat, Discover is a way to engage users more deeply. Publishers see Discover as an avenue to reach a new and younger audience. From the start, Snapchat approached news differently from other social networks. While Facebook has said it is not a media company and does not want to be an arbiter of truth in news on its website, Snapchat has long prohibited false or deceptive content and is thoroughly involved in editorial standards for content on Discover. In a blog post published when Discover began, Snapchat said: “Social media companies tell us what to read based on what’s most recent or most popular. We see it differently. We count on editors and artists, not clicks and shares, to determine what’s important. ” As a result, Snapchat has always exercised a large degree of control over Discover. To secure a place on Discover, publishers have had to agree to fairly stringent guidelines around editing and video production, including having audio play at a consistent volume and a ban on images that are misleading or gimmicky. Snapchat also mandated that all images and headlines be appropriate for an audience as young as 13 years old. Discover has grown quickly. More than 100 million Snapchat users view content on Discover each month, according to the company. While some publishers said people were initially slow to embrace Discover, interest has increased over the past year. Tastemade, which publishes different editions for different areas around the world on Discover, said it had been pleased enough with the size of its Snapchat audience that it planned to grow with Snapchat as it rolled out worldwide. Still, Snapchat has not been able to entirely sidestep criticism about what it shows on Discover. In July, a   lawsuit filed against the company alleged that Discover intentionally exposed minors “to harmful, offensive, prurient and sexually offensive content without warning minors or their parents that they would be exposed to such explicit content. ” The lawsuit cited examples of inappropriate content on Discover, like a post from BuzzFeed that sexualized images from Disney movies and a post from Cosmopolitan, with photos, about a performance artist who let strangers touch her genitalia. While the lawsuit was dismissed in November because the sides agreed to settle, Snapchat said it had decided to take action in response to the litigation. It soon created a new tool, which Snapchat said it had been discussing for a while, that let publishers prevent Snapchat users who were under age 18 from seeing certain content. When people sign up for Snapchat, they must enter their age and a phone number that is confirmed by the service. Snapchat also reserves the right to gate content for youngsters, even if a publisher has chosen not to do so. In updating its publisher guidelines, Snapchat aimed to clarify vague language and provide more examples around its restrictions on the use of nudity, profanity and violent images. The new rules more clearly state that publishers should not use overly sexualized or violent images as the initial visual that users are exposed to when they look at Discover and that content intended simply to shock or disgust is not allowed. Some exceptions are made for   material that has news value. For the first time, the guidelines have a dedicated section detailing the warnings that publishers must run when graphic images are deemed newsworthy, as well as when to   that content. Some of these updates came out of conversations that began months ago with several publishers that routinely published racier content, including The Daily Mail and Cosmopolitan, as well as news services that published controversial images. “We have been collaborating closely with all of our publishers, whose content has continued to evolve,” said Nick Bell, Snapchat’s vice president for content. “We want to be a great partner to all of our editorial partners, and updating our content guidelines to better reflect where our platform is today is an important part of that. ” One of the publishers that talked with Snapchat about the new rules was Sweet, a   channel created by the media company Hearst, which said its viewership on Discover had grown substantially over the past few months. Ross Clark, Sweet’s general manager and vice president, likened the updated guidelines to a parental advisory sticker on an album or to ratings on movies. “The media industry has always included clearly established content guidelines,” Mr. Clark said. “It’s what allows a platform to have a large, diverse set of users. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Officials at the Transportation Security Administration thought they had the solution for long lines at airports: PreCheck, a program that allowed people to move through security without taking off their shoes or removing electronics from their luggage. It has not worked as planned. Customers who apply for the program, which requires a fee of $85 and a background check, say they continue to face long waits to obtain the PreCheck clearance. Such delays could grow worse because the number of people signing up for PreCheck has more than tripled in the last few months, climbing to 16, 000 a day on average in May, agency officials said. That surge has led to long delays in processing applications. Dozens of passengers who have recently tried to sign up for PreCheck say they have been given appointments for the   interviews needed to complete the process that are weeks or even months away. Vance Hiner of St. Louis said he was put on a   waiting list at  . Louis International Airport to complete his enrollment. “The process of looking at my face and verifying that my passport and driver’s license match could be done by literally any   airport staffer,” he said in an email. Roger Golliver of Beaverton, Ore. a suburb of Portland, said his wife signed up for the PreCheck program in March. But she had to wait months for an interview. “The earliest she could find was a July date in Seattle,” he said. Seattle is about a   drive from Portland. Officials at the T. S. A. and MorphoTrust USA, the company that handles all PreCheck applications, say they are aware of the problems and are working to increase the number of enrollment centers while hiring additional people to deal with the surge in applications. “We are adding as much capacity as quickly as possible,” said John Sammon, the chief marketing officer for the T. S. A. Charles Carroll, senior vice president for identity services at MorphoTrust, said the company was hiring additional staff to bolster its efforts at the 14 biggest airports, including in New York and Chicago, where 450 passengers at Chicago O’Hare International Airport missed their flights last month because of long lines. “We’re in emergency response mode,” Mr. Carroll said. “T. S. A. was caught off guard by the size and amount of people traveling. ” The agency has made some improvements in reducing wait times at airports. It has increased overtime for screeners and moved dozens of   dog teams to larger airports from smaller ones. On the busy Memorial Day weekend, few travelers reported a long wait. More help is on the way. This year, Congress allowed the agency to use $34 million to hire nearly 800 new screeners. And lawmakers recently approved an additional $28 million that will allow the agency to convert 2, 784 screeners from part time to full time, which will add 53 security lanes at the nation’s airports. Some members of Congress and many in the travel industry wonder if the efforts will be sustainable throughout the peak of summer travel. “T. S. A. cannot continue to rely on temporary   by moving around limited Homeland Security dollars,” said Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi. John S. Pistole, the former T. S. A. administrator who started the PreCheck program, argued that using   intelligence to screen and move   passengers through security checkpoints was a better way to protect airports. Information provided by those who sign up for PreCheck is checked against the F. B. I. ’s criminal history databases as well as several terrorist screening databases and   lists. The initial challenge was the reverse of today: The T. S. A. could not persuade enough people to sign up for PreCheck, and at many airports the PreCheck lanes were empty as regular security lines backed up. So the agency started a program called managed inclusion, which allowed people who had not signed up for the program to go through expedited screening when regular lines grew long. An investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that screeners allowed investigators with fake bombs and weapons to pass through checkpoints in 95 percent of the tests, a finding first reported by ABC News last year. Peter V. Neffenger, who took over the agency last July, ended the practice of managed inclusion. But fixing that problem has contributed to the long security lines that the agency is now trying to solve. On Wednesday, Kelly Hoggan, who had been the assistant administrator for the Office of Security Operations for the T. S. A. since 2013, resigned. Mr. Hoggan had been reassigned in May after a backlash over long security lines at airports and congressional scrutiny of thousands of dollars in bonuses he had received. Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, is trying to enlist help from the private sector to persuade more people to sign up for PreCheck. In a letter to the 100 largest American companies, he asked that they reimburse employees for signing up for expedited screening programs. The agency is also seeking additional vendors, in addition to MorphoTrust, to help process PreCheck enrollment. Still, it is unclear if those efforts will be enough to reduce the long lines expected at airports this summer.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. congressional negotiators are making progress on resolving a dispute that has stalled a bill to impose new sanctions on Russia, congressional aides said on Thursday, and one lawmaker said the matter could be resolved as soon as Friday. “I think as soon as tomorrow, the House (of Representatives) could pass it out,” Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an author of the bill, told reporters. He said he expected the House to make changes that would not affect the bill’s overall character and to address issues that have worried energy companies, such as a provision that oil firms said could block them out of international exploration projects if Russian firms were also involved. Hoping to send a message to President Donald Trump to maintain a strong line against Moscow, the Senate passed the sanctions on Russia, part of a broader measure also imposing new sanctions on Iran, by 98-2 on June 15. The bill has been mired in the House ever since. The delay has frustrated Democrats, and some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, who think the president is so eager to improve relations with Russia that he will not retaliate for Moscow’s international aggression. This week, Trump has been defending his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who met with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign after he was told she might have damaging information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Republicans, who control Congress, said the House could not vote on the Senate bill because it violated a constitutional requirement that legislation affecting government revenues originate in the House. Democrats accused Republicans of stalling because of Trump administration concern about a provision setting up a process for Congress to approve any effort by the president to ease sanctions on Russia. Seeking a greater influence in foreign policy, Congress has included such “review” provisions in a few recent major bills, starting with Corker’s 2015 legislation forcing congressional review of President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran. Corker said he thought there should be more congressional review of foreign policy. “It’s been my goal as chairman just to bring back our equivalent status to the executive branch, and this is one way of doing so.”  House aides said negotiations on the Russia bill were continuing. “No deal has been reached, but talks have been productive and will continue,” said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan.

0,WELFake Dataset,"It was revealed Monday that President Obama’s national security adviser Susan Rice allegedly ordered the unmasking of the identities of Trump campaign aides who were reportedly being surveilled during the 2016 election. [The recent reports further prove, at least in part, President Donald Trump’s claims that senior Obama officials had collected intelligence on Trump aids and disseminated it throughout the government. Rice’s involvement  —   as it relates to her reported role in the unmasking of Trump aids and circulating sensitive information  —   places the longtime Obama operative at the center of another major political scandal.  Below are five facts from Susan Rice scandals every American should know. 1. Susan Rice allegedly ordered surveillance of Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign aides as part of a political intelligence operation.  Rice allegedly maintained spreadsheets of Trump aides’ telephone calls “one year before the 2016 presidential election,” according to the Daily Caller. The Daily Caller reports: “What was produced by the intelligence community at the request of Ms. Rice were detailed spreadsheets of intercepted phone calls with unmasked Trump associates in perfectly legal conversations with individuals,” diGenova told The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group Monday. “The overheard conversations involved no illegal activity by anybody of the Trump associates, or anyone they were speaking with,” diGenova said. “In short, the only apparent illegal activity was the unmasking of the people in the calls. ” 2. Rice claimed that climate change was responsible for the deadly civil war in Syria.  “In the years prior to civil war breaking out in Syria, that country also experienced its worst drought on record,” Rice said in October 2015, during a speech at Stanford University. “Farming families moved en masse into urban centers, increasing political unrest and further priming the country for conflict. ” Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed in the conflict since President Barack Obama drew his infamous “red line” in 2012, promising to retaliate against Syrian President Bashar  ’s regime if it used chemical weapons on its own people. 3. Rice once declared that there is “no military solution” to the raging conflict in Yemen. “As in Syria, there is no military solution to the crisis in Yemen,” Rice said in April 2015, during a speech at the Arab American Institute’s Kahlil Gibran Gala. Seven months before Rice’s speech, President Obama had called his administration’s drone   military operation in Yemen a success story. President Trump, however, ordered more airstrikes against   in Yemen in February than any year in Obama’s presidency. 4. Susan Rice said accused deserter Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl served “with honor and distinction. ” In March 2015, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was charged with treason for allegedly deserting his fellow soldiers and abandoning his Afghanistan outpost in 2009. In a June 2014 broadcast of ABC’s This Week, Susan Rice defended Bergdahl, saying he “served the United States with honor and distinction. And we’ll have the opportunity eventually to learn what has transpired in the past years. ” As Breitbart News reported, six soldiers lost their lives searching for   First Class Bowe Bergdahl after he abandoned his outpost. 5. Susan Rice was the driving force behind a misinformation campaign about the Sept. 11, 2012, Benghazi terror attacks.    Ambassador Rice, acting as the Obama White House’s spokeswoman, appeared on five Sunday morning talk shows and repeatedly claimed that the Benghazi attacks had been caused by an   video. Rice appeared on ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News, and CNN and regurgitated talking points purporting that the protests that had erupted “spontaneously” near two U. S. government facilities in Benghazi, Libya and were a result of a “hateful video” that was offensive to Islam. But government documents, released following a Judicial Watch lawsuit, reveal that government officials monitoring the attack in   did not cite an   video as an explanation for the paramilitary attack on the U. S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi. In May 2015 interview, former Obama CIA Director Mike Morell said Rice’s Benghazi talking points blaming an   YouTube video crossed “the line between national security and politics. ” “I think the line in there that says one of our objectives here right on the Sunday show is to blame the video rather than a failure of policy,” Morell said on Fox News’ Special Report. “And as you know, I say in the book that I think that that is crossing the line between national security and politics. ” Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Donald Trump s Co-Chair of the  Veterans For Trump Coalition in New Hampshire, Jerry Delemus, was just arrested by the FBI on nine charges, including conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States.Jerry Delemus, a significant component of Trump s campaign effort to attract veterans, is a Tea Party activist who made trips to take part in the Bundy Ranch stand-off. According to the indictment being brought against him, Delemus was  a mid-level leader and organizer of the conspiracy who, among other things: recruited, organized, trained and provided logistical support to gunmen and other followers and organized and led armed patrols and security checkpoints. Delemus s connection to Trump is certainly a factor, but it s also damaging to the Republican party as a whole. Jerry s wife, Susan Delemus, is a GOP lawmaker in the state of New Hampshire s House of Representatives. News of the incident first broke when Susan called Jack Kimball, the former chairman of the New Hampshire GOP to let him know that the FBI was raiding their house. Here s what Kimball wrote on Facebook:  She said that the FBI just rolled up with lots of vehicles and Agents who were in tactical gear. They forced their way into Jerry Delemus and Sue s condo with weapons drawn and arrested Jerry and took him away. Currently, the FBI is not taking questions on the matter and is asking that anyone needing more information to get in contact with the Department of Justice. As of right now, the U.S. DOJ has not gotten back in touch with local newspaper Portsmouth Patch, who reported on it first.Here is a list of the charges Delemus is currently being faced with:In addition to taking part in the armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Preserve in Oregon, Delemus was a security team member on the Bundy Ranch in Nevada.Even though these charges are quite serious (and factual) it s likely the right is going to chalk this up as retaliation for being either 1) a Trump supporter or 2) because of their anti-government beliefs.Delemus s wife had already been an outspoken proponent of big government and lying politicians, even before the FBI ransacked her home. That is, everyone but Trump. You may remember her face from a recent CNN survey she did, in which she professed her ardent support for the man:  We ve got people in positions of power who I know for a fact are liars. Liars! I watch the TV   My president comes on the TV and he lies to me! I know he s lying. He lies all the time.  Trump supporter:  I believe Donald. I m telling you   he says what I m thinking.  https://t.co/K0KNfPh6Gp @CNNPolitics  Eugene Scott (@Eugene_Scott) December 10, 2015No, Delemus was not arrested because of his  Trump  beliefs.

0,WELFake Dataset,"KRAKOW, Poland (Reuters) - Demanding reparations from Germany for its actions in Poland during World War Two is a matter of honor for Warsaw, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Polish ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, said on Saturday.  The issue of reparations, revived by Poland s eurosceptic PiS after decades of improving relations with Germany, could escalate tensions between the two European Union members. In September Polish parliamentary legal experts ruled that Warsaw has the right to demand reparations from Germany, although Poland s foreign minister indicated that no immediate claim would be made.  The French were paid, Jews were paid, many other nations were paid for the losses they suffered during World War Two. Poles were not,  Kaczynski said.   It is not only about material funds. It is about our status, our honor ... And this is not theater. This is our demand, a totally serious demand,  added Kaczynski, Poland s de facto leader.  The PiS government, deeply distrustful of Germany, has raised calls for wartime compensation in recent months but Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski has said further analysis was needed before any claims were lodged. Six million Poles, including three million Polish Jews, were killed during the war, and the capital Warsaw was razed to the ground in 1944 after a failed uprising in which 200,000 civilians died.

Republican volunteers called 911 claiming Clinton supporters were Harassing them. 
Volunteers canvassing and dropping off literature at houses Monday for Nevada Republican senate candidate Rep. Joe Heck were followed by supporters of Hillary Clinton, who then subsequently pulled down the literature, a source within the Nevada Republican Party told The Daily Caller in an exclusive report. The staffers following them were wearing HRC buttons and HRC stickers. Beyond following them, the HRC workers began going up to houses and illegally removing Heck literature from the doors,” the Nevada GOP source said. “When the Heck volunteers noticed this going on, they stopped to take pictures of the illegal action.” The source said that, “Within a few minutes, more HRC campaign workers showed up. At this point, the Heck volunteers began to feel threatened and called 911 to report HRC workers illegally removing campaign literature and harassing the Heck volunteers.” 
Reports like the case in Nevada may seem minor to some, but those that have been called to pray over this election know that it only confirms the need for prayer. The kind of anger and even violence that can manifest during and after elections is something to be taken seriously. We have seen violence erupt during elections in other countries, and it certainly isn't something we want to see in the United States. The call is to pray without ceasing Church!

Black teen conservative political activist and Internet sensation CJ Pearson, 13, touted his endorsement of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) for president during an exclusive interview on Breitbart News Sunday. In 2016 it is time for us to mend the divisive traits that this president has inflicted upon our country. And I believe Ted [Cruz] can be that uniter,  Pearson told Breitbart s Matthew Boyle. He said he sees Cruz as a  fighter for conservative values; a fighter who will not give up, who will not give in to the D.C. establishment   left or right   and will fight for what he believes in. Pearson shot to national acclaim when he created a video on YouTube in February criticizing President Barack Obama. The video, titled  President Obama: Do You Really Love America?  quickly garnered over a million hits and he has since appeared on several mainstream media outlets to discuss his views. I think his entire term has been a downright failure, has been an embarrassment to this country,  Pearson said of Obama s presidency. He criticized the commander in chief for making a big government even bigger and for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, among other controversial policies. Obama, in Pearson s estimation,  is a leader who is more likely to apologize for America than to sit and fight for America. Pearson, who lives in Georgia, serves as the national coordinator for Students for Cruz, which is the official youth arm for the Cruz for President campaign.

They blocked a ramp to Interstate 64 off Clark Street, but were blocked by police from entering the highway. Protesters then headed to police headquarters.Christina Wilson, the fiance of the victim Anthony Lamar Smith,  bravely stood in front of a microphone prior to the court s announcement and asked for protesters to not resort to violence.Inspired by your courage, Christina.

0,WELFake Dataset,"If Donald Trump thinks being president means he can t be prosecuted for his crimes, he should think again.As it turns out, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has the power to indict Trump if he has enough evidence proving that Trump committed a criminal act such as colluding with Russia in an effort to win the 2016 Election. Donald Trump s son Trump Jr. has already demonstrated that Trump s campaign met with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer and a former Soviet Intelligence officer in order to get dirt to use against Hillary Clinton, which is, indeed, the very definition of collusion.Mueller s power to indict is confirmed by a 56-page legal memo written by Ronald Rotunda, a conservative professor of constitutional law and ethics, who was hired as part of Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr s team during the Bill Clinton presidency.According to the 1998 memo, which was obtained by the New York Times,It is proper, constitutional, and legal for a federal grand jury to indict a sitting president for serious criminal acts that are not part of, and are contrary to, the president s official duties. In this country, no one, even President Clinton, is above the law.That means no sitting president is above the law, including Trump.Watergate special counsel, Leon Jaworski, came to the same conclusion in 1974.The only reason why Jaworski and Starr declined to indict President Nixon and President Clinton is because they chose to let impeachment proceedings play out instead.Well, Republicans have thus far done everything they can to protect Trump from being impeached. So it appears Mueller may not have a choice but to indict Trump if Republicans continue to refuse to do their public duty.Even the Supreme Court has ruled that sitting presidents are not above the law by deciding in 1997 that a lawsuit against Clinton for misconduct prior to becoming president can move forward. And since Trump was not president when he and his campaign colluded with Russia, that makes his misconduct open to indictment, along with any other crimes he committed prior to taking office. That means if Mueller digs through Trump s finances and finds other crimes, Trump could face an indictment for those as well. If there is no recourse against the president, if he cannot be prosecuted for violating the criminal laws, he will be above the law,  Rotunda further wrote. If public policy and the Constitution allow a private litigant to sue a sitting president for acts that are not part of the president s official duties (and are outside the outer perimeter of those duties), and that is what Clinton v. Jones squarely held, then one would think that an indictment is constitutional because the public interest in criminal cases is greater. In short, Trump is in deep shit and he can t blame Hillary Clinton to get out of it. Not even Republicans can dispute the Starr memo. Republicans not only supported Starr s investigation, it was a conservative legal mind who wrote the memo.So unless Republicans proceed with impeachment proceedings to get to the bottom of this once and for all, Robert Mueller must indict Trump. Because it is clear that Republicans won t punish Trump for breaking the law and violating the Constitution.Featured Image: Addicting Info Archive",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Republicans say Social Security’s support for people with disabilities will be 'broke' next year; the Obama budget suggests the system needs only a patch. But both sides agree: Something must be done by 2016.

Why are Americans more open to torture than other nations?

Senate Budget Committee ranking member Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) of Vermont (l.) talks as committee chairman Sen. Michael Enzi (R) of Wyoming listens during a hearing of the Senate Budget Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington earlier this month

In the wake of Republican victories in the election last fall, pundits warned that Congress would be at loggerheads with President Obama on a number of budget issues in 2015, including over highway funding and the Department of Homeland Security.

Not high on the list of hot topics: Social Security.

Yet the vaunted social insurance system is suddenly a hot part of the fiscal debate in Washington – and it's not waiting for 2016 elections. The new Obama budget proposes a patch to the program’s support for people with disabilities, but Republicans say the system needs an overhaul, not a Band-Aid.

How urgent an issue is this? Specifically, how real is the financial trouble for the disability program?

The two sides are far apart on their characterizations, but they agree that something needs to be done, and a good case can be made that the reality is between the extremes.

Many Democrats and liberals say, in effect, that Social Security’s Disability Insurance program is in trouble only if Republicans refuse to rubber stamp Mr. Obama’s fix.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) of Vermont, the top member of the Democratic caucus on the Senate Budget Committee, accused Republicans of trying “to manufacture a crisis where none exists.”

On the Republican side, Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming, who chairs that panel, says that “by December of next year, the program will be broke.”

What's new is that after years of talk about Social Security's solvency and the need to reform it (or not), Congress has come to its first definitive fork in the road on the issue. Perhaps the problem isn’t as dire as Republicans say it is, but Obama also might not have a slam-dunk case for his patch.

A good many economists agree with the Republican view that reforms are needed to keep the system solvent – and the sooner they’re enacted, the better it will be for the nation’s fiscal health.

Here are key facts behind the rhetoric:

These facts suggest that Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah had a valid point when he argued this week on the Senate floor that “having a joint trust fund exhaustion as a target doesn’t solve any fundamental financial problem facing ... Social Security.”

At the same time, Democrats have a point when they note that rebalancing the tax revenues between the two trust funds has been done by Congress many times in the past.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget notes that Congress has reallocated tax receipts between these two funds in the past, but generally accompanied by reforms to Social Security.

House Republicans are seeking to block any such reallocation, unless it’s accompanied by reforms to shore up Social Security so promised benefits can be paid beyond 2033.

The Social Security trustees said in their 2014 annual report that although Congress may consider another rebalancing, such a move ""might serve to delay DI reforms and much needed financial corrections for OASDI as a whole.""

Regardless of whether the tax flows are rebalanced, the two programs may call for differing reforms to bolster their solvency.

In the old-age program, possible fixes include asking high-earning Americans to shoulder bigger tax burdens, modestly raising the retirement age, and adjusting the inflation index used for benefits (so that annual cost-of-living increases aren’t so big).

On the disability side, changes might include expanding incentives for people to work rather than rely on DI benefits. “Increasing employment among individuals with disabilities could improve their economic well-being and increase their autonomy while also reducing the fiscal strains on Social Security,” Stanford University economist Mark Duggan argued at a Senate hearing this week.

The disability program has grown markedly in recent years. By 2012 it was accounting for 18 percent of all Social Security benefits, up from 10 percent in 1970, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

Much of the expansion stemmed from demographics, as an aging population included more people developing disabilities in their later work years, a 2013 CBO analysis concluded. But it also found the growth in the program to be related to 1984 legislation that loosened the definition of conditions qualifying as disabilities, and in fluctuations in the economy – such as the long jobs drought following the 2008 financial crisis.

“The DI rolls have barely grown for the last two years,” notes Kathy Ruffing of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

That slowdown coincides with an easing of demographic pressures on the program, as the baby boomers retire, as well as the improving economy.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON  —   There is nothing in Donald J. Trump’s or Hillary Clinton’s antiterrorism plans that would have had much chance of stopping the bombings in New York and New Jersey that Ahmad Khan Rahami is accused of carrying out. The subject of how to prevent terrorism will almost certainly be a major topic on Monday night, when the two presidential candidates face off in their first debate. But the truth is that cases like Mr. Rahami’s fit neatly into no categories. And his journey from childhood immigrant to naturalized citizen to accused terrorist shows that the debate now underway on the campaign trail is too simplistic. It fails to address the hardest and most common cause of radicalization in the United States, when personal demons morph into ideologically driven violence. Mr. Rahami came to the United States from Afghanistan as a    and later became a citizen. Mr. Trump’s insistence in recent days that he has no problem with ethnic profiling might have led to tougher interrogations of Mr. Rahami when he traveled to Quetta, Pakistan, the center of Taliban power, and returned, or when he came back from there with a Pakistani wife. The strongest indication of his leanings came in 2014 when the local police and the F. B. I. investigated Mr. Rahami’s father’s claim that his son was a terrorist. But finding no evidence, the authorities did not act. Since Mr. Rahami is an American citizen, the only way he could have been locked up without being charged was with a detention system similar to the way   were placed in Japanese “internment camps” during World War II. That was a technique, Mr. Trump told Time magazine in December, that he might or might not have supported at the time. He added that as undesirable as it would be to revive such an arrangement, in an age of terrorism, “war is tough. ” Mrs. Clinton’s approach would be to rely on countermessaging to prevent radicalization and to try to recognize early signs of extremism. But no one seems quite certain how Mr. Rahami was radicalized  —   on the internet, during trips to Pakistan or perhaps by his new wife. And Mrs. Clinton’s approach, even its advocates acknowledge, is no guarantee  —   it tries to stem the tide, rather than reverse it. Mr. Trump, in short, has described a policy of keeping potential terrorists out of the country altogether, even if that means suspending or violating America’s longstanding principles of taking in refugees and not discriminating against immigrants on the basis of their religion. Mrs. Clinton, in contrast, has argued for the vetting of immigrants  —   about their history or sympathy for radical ideology  —   but working to counter extremists messages or behavior. A core element of Mrs. Clinton’s counterterrorism strategy has been to build on pilot programs in four communities that, among other features, offer residents ways to report individuals who could become radicalized or otherwise exhibit troubling behavior. The four communities are  . Paul, Los Angeles, Boston and Montgomery County, Md. In the Elizabeth, N. J. neighborhood where Mr. Rahami lived and worked, such a program might  —   or might not  —   have made a difference. In recent years, for instance, some friends of Mr. Rahami’s noticed a significant change in his personality and religious devotion after a trip to Afghanistan, where he and his relatives are from. But there is no evidence that they alerted anyone, or expressed any concern. Mrs. Clinton aims to set up an   system, community by community. That builds on a growing number of programs that the Obama administration terms “countering violent extremism. ” The aim is not just to rely on religious leaders such as imams to help detect the early signs of radicalization, but also to enlist teachers, coaches, physicians and others who might notice subtle changes in an individual’s behavior and, perhaps with family and friends, intervene. Mrs. Clinton also suggested, in December, that she would accelerate work with technology companies to take radical speech off Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat and encrypted apps used by terrorists. “You are going to hear all the familiar complaints: ‘Freedom of speech,’” she told the Brookings Institution. She suggested those complaints should be dismissed. Her advisers acknowledge this would not constitute a complete solution  —   but neither would immigration bans, which they view as counter to American values. “Look, we’re never going to be able to identify every potential bad actor solely through a police record or their involvement with other bad actors,” said Daniel Benjamin, a former State Department terrorism coordinator and now a scholar at Dartmouth College. “So having more eyes on this, and more awareness within communities, is absolutely essential, and will have to be a key part of the solution. ” Mr. Benjamin, who is an adviser to the Clinton campaign, acknowledged Tuesday that “there’s no guarantee that such programs would have identified Rahami ahead of time. ” But he said Mr. Rahami’s case, and that of a   man who stabbed 10 people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minn. before he was shot and killed by an   police officer, “appear to be examples of fairly dramatic changes in behavior that might have set off alarms. ” Mrs. Clinton spoke by phone for 45 minutes on Tuesday morning with a group of top national security and counterterrorism advisers about lessons learned from the most recent terrorist attacks and what additional steps a Clinton administration would need to take to prevent strikes on American soil, according to a summary of the call that the campaign released. They also discussed how to ensure that the police and other law enforcement agencies followed up on individuals who had been previously identified as possible threats. Mrs. Clinton has called for “an intelligence surge” to improve information sharing among federal agencies and with foreign partners. Mrs. Clinton and her advisers mulled over ways to combat     attacks and online radicalization  —   without specific direction or enabling from groups like the Islamic State or Al Qaeda  —   and “how we can best balance the right to privacy with this modern national security imperative,” according to the summary. Finally, the group examined “the dangers of inflammatory rhetoric, generalizations and expressions of prejudice,” all of which Mrs. Clinton and her supporters have accused Mr. Trump of using in his social media comments and campaign speeches. Mr. Trump has one word for those solutions: “Weak. ” He argued during the primaries that he would temporarily ban all Muslim immigration, a position that received withering criticism from his own party. (He also said he would “take out” the families of terrorists, a violation of international conventions.) He combined that with what he maintains would be a far more relentless attack on the Islamic State, including seizing oil in areas where it operates, presumably in Iraq (although most of the oil belongs to Iraq, and the Bush administration always went to some lengths to say it would be preserved for the benefit of the Iraqi people, not sold by the United States). Under pressure, Mr. Trump amended his approach to saying he would temporarily ban immigration from countries that have been breeding grounds for terrorism he seemed to have Afghanistan and Pakistan in mind. But that definition could easily embrace Germany, France, Belgium and Britain as well. Had that program been in effect in 1995, it might have stopped Mr. Rahami’s entry into the country as a    or his readmission in 2000, when he and his family were admitted as refugees. Mr. Trump said in a rally on Tuesday that the lesson of the New York and New Jersey bombing attacks was the need for an immigration crackdown. “These attacks were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country,” he said. “Attack after attack  —   from   to San Bernardino to Orlando  —   we have seen how failure to screen who is entering the United States puts all of our citizens in great danger. ” He said Mrs. Clinton was “for people pouring in from Syria,” though the 10, 000 refugees who have come from there this year is a tiny fraction of what European nations have taken in. Mr. Trump called for stopping “the massive inflow of refugees, which Hillary Clinton is trying to drastically increase. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German parties exploring a coalition government have dealt an early blow to French President Emmanuel Macron s hopes for more expansive fiscal policies from Berlin, backing a balanced budget and rejecting the idea of a separate pot of cash for the euro zone. The Greens, seen as closest to Macron on economic policy and Europe, appeared to have caved in to demands by Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives and the Free Democrats (FDP) that a new government continue down a path of fiscal discipline. Merkel, whose conservatives placed first but lost seats in an election last month, is trying to forge a coalition with the pro-business FDP and the Greens, which requires bridging disagreements on taxes, immigration and foreign policy. In a joint paper agreed after late-night talks on Tuesday, the parties said they all supported a balanced budget. A senior Greens politician who participated in the talks also told Reuters that the parties were united in opposing Macron s idea for a euro zone budget.  None of the participating parties support a euro zone budget,  said Reinhard Buetikofer, a member of the European Parliament. The parties are expected to reconvene on Thursday to finalize a joint paper on Europe, after agreeing a rough blueprint for fiscal policy late on Tuesday. That blueprint included a pledge to respect  debt brake  legislation enshrined in the constitution since 2009, which forces the federal government to virtually eliminate structural budget deficits, limiting them to 0.35 percent of GDP. It also contained a commitment to provide relief to lower and middle income earners, dismantle the  solidarity tax  for poor eastern states and provide financial incentives to make German homes more energy efficient. Cem Ozdemir, a leader of the Greens who is seen as a possible foreign minister in the new government, highlighted a decision to re-examine plans to raise defence spending by the outgoing  grand coalition  of Merkel s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD), who are moving into opposition. Tax relief and investment needs would be finalised once more details on tax revenues become available next month, Ozdemir said, suggesting that the balanced budget commitment was not final. The Greens politician also said that a new coalition would have to provide a  pro-European  answer to proposals from Macron and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker for closer cooperation in fiscal matters, defence and migration.  There are a lot of differences to overcome. But I am hoping for a clear commitment to Europe,  said Ozdemir in a video posted on the Greens website. Buetikofer said the Greens supported the idea of boosting investment within the framework of the existing EU budget. But their rejection of Macron s idea for a separate budget for the euro zone at such an early stage of the coalition talks was seen by some members of the party as an unnecessary  cave in  to Merkel s conservatives and the FDP. Macron has called for the creation of a euro zone budget of several hundred billions of euros to help the single currency bloc cope with economic shocks. One FDP participant who requested anonymity suggested that the Greens may have given away too much in the talks on Tuesday night and expressed concern that the leadership of the party could be forced to change tack in the days ahead by angry grass roots members. Former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat who ruled with the Greens for seven years, accused the environmentalist party of  preparing Frau Merkel s bed  in a desperate attempt to re-enter government.

During a rant about the president s suggestion that the U.K. not leave the European Union, Boris Johnson ripped into the president for his decision to remove a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office: Some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan president s ancestral dislike of the British empire   of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender. In reality, the president removed the bust of the British icon, placed there by George W. Bush, to make way for one more relevant to the United States: Martin Luther King, Jr. President Obama says that he had Churchill removed because There s only so many busts you can have before it starts looking a little cluttered in there. This incident provided us with a macabre ability to feel relieved that other countries have their  Tea Parties,  as well. In the United Kingdom, such a group would be the Tories. The remark was widely condemned as racist, with Labour leaders condemning Johnson s  dog whistle  remark. In fact, he was directly compared to the Tea Party:Labour s shadow chancellor John McDonnnell tweeted:  Mask slips again. Boris part-Kenyan Obama comment is yet another example of dog whistle racism from senior Tories. He should withdraw it. Fellow Labour frontbencher Diane Abbott said that what Mr. Johnson had written was  offensive  and echoed words used by the  Tea Party  right-wing tendency in the US.Former Lib. Dem. leader Lord Campbell added that Mr. Johnson s comments were  an unacceptable smear , adding:  If this is an illustration of the kind of diplomacy that we might expect from a Johnson leadership of the Tory Party then heaven help us. Now, college students are standing up and refusing to allow the racist mayor to get away with his bigoted rhetoric. Right-wing lie-factory Breitbart complains that  Safe Space Stalinists  and  footsoldiers of orthodoxy and conformism  at King s College are PC-ing up the place. In fact, they talked it over and decided that they don t want him stinking up their campus. In an email canceling the mayor s plans to speak to a group of students called King s Think Tank, informed Johnson: The level of discourse over the past few days does not meet the bar we set for these events nor do we feel does it help the British people in making the most momentous decision of our lifetime. Furthermore,  they added,  we believe it does not reflect the true greatness of the United Kingdom, a land of tolerance, respect and fair play towards all .Next part of #borisjohnson backlash of his Obama ancestry comments.

0,WELFake Dataset,"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer ripped into the media on Friday for continuing to ask questions about a connection between the Trump campaign and Russia, noting that there’s been no evidence of that. [“Everyone who’s been briefed on this subject, from Republican to Democrat to CIA  —   former Obama administration’s [Director of National Intelligence James] Clapper, [CIA Director John] Brennan, you name it  —   all of the people come back with the same conclusion  …    that there’s been no evidence,” he said at the White House press briefing.  Spicer said if anyone was trying to engage with Russia, it was Hillary Clinton. “It was Hillary Clinton, who was the architect of the last administration’s failed reset policy  —   she told Russian state TV that it was designed to strengthen Russia. That was their goal: to strengthen Russia,” he said. “She used her office to make concession after concession, selling off   of our country’s uranium, paid speeches, paid deals, getting personal calls from Vladimir Putin. I think if there’s  —   really want to talk about a Russian connection and the substance, that’s where we should be looking,” he added. Spicer was referring to how in 2010,   of State Clinton was one of nine to sign off on Russia’s purchase of a controlling stake in Uranium One, an international mining company headquartered in Canada. Around the same time, a Russian investment bank paid Bill Clinton $500, 000 to give a speech. “When you talk about connections to Russia, the only connection that anyone’s made with President Trump is multiple years ago he hosted a pageant there and he’s  —   some of the  —   you know, he owns condos around the world and some of them were sold to some Russians and I think he sold a house to one several years back. That’s his connection,” he said. “So when you compare the two sides in terms of who’s actually engaging with Russia, trying to strengthen them, trying to act with them, trying to interact with them, it is night and day between our actions and her actions,” he said. “And yet no one questioned what she was doing or how she was handling it. ” Critics of President Trump have argued that his campaign aides colluded with Russia to help him get elected. While intelligence officials have assessed that Russia tried to interfere in the U. S. elections in favor of Trump by hacking into the Democratic National Committee and Clinton aide John Podesta and leaking embarrassing emails, there has been no evidence that Russia affected the outcome of the election or that there was collusion with Trump campaign officials. The FBI is investigating the matter, and the House and Senate intelligence committees are also investigating it. But Clapper told NBC News on March 5 that no evidence existed that showed any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “Not to my knowledge,” he said, when asked if any evidence existed. Clapper said there could have been information found since he left the government on January 20, but as of then, “We had no evidence of such collusion. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Constipation can be incredibly painful; however, it can also take a big toll on the body. Fortunately, there is a 100% natural solution to constipation.
Big pharmaceutical companies don’t want you to know that some of the artificial medication for constipation significantly reduce the effectiveness of the intestines. As a result, some people report that without taking certain medication, they can’t visit the toilet.
The good news is, you can solve constipation quite easily. But let’s delve deeply into what constipation can do to the body first.
Bad Breath Firstly, constipation can cause bad breath (halitosis). Unfortunately, people who suffer from bad breath don’t always realize that they have a problem. People are unlikely to point out to a person that their breath stinks; therefore, they might miss out on social events and job opportunities due to bad breath. Constipation can cause bad breath because there is a build up of toxic waste and the gasses rise up through the body.
Rectal Issues & Infection As stools spend more time in the bowels, water is reabsorbed. As a result, stools get hard and dry. Some constipation suffers report that passing bowels becomes very painful and can take many hours. As a result, the rectum is stretched beyond its limits. This can lead to rectal prolapse, which is a rectum which fails to close. Rectal prolapse sufferers usually wear diapers because stool leaks out of them. Moreover, they are more prone to infection.
Increase Toxins The skin is the largest organ in the body and is a reflection of a person’s general health. Constipation typically increases the buildup of toxins in the body. As a result, the skin has to work harder to eliminate toxins. This can cause acne, skin discoloration etc. Therefore, if your skin is bad, don’t buy an expensive beauty product. Take a look at your diet, and whether you suffer from constipation. The skin is a reflection of inner health.
Colon Cancer Constipation can also cause colon cancer. The colon is designed to hold a few pounds of stools. Think of it like a plastic bag. Overload with heavy items and it rips. It’s primary function is to transport stool. However, when an individual is constipated, it has to store stool. This puts a strain on the inner membrane and can cause ruptures and internal infections. Invasive surgery may be required in such instances.
Loss Of Healthy Bacteria The intestines contain flora (healthy bacteria) which help with immunity and vitamin production. Constipation reduces the concentration of flora, thereby leaving sufferers more susceptible to infection and illness. Moreover, they help to keep stools soft. Therefore, constipation sufferers can go through a downward spiral whereby their condition worsens over time.
As people age, they are more likely to get constipated. Moreover, it is more likely to have a serious effect on their health. This is because the body isn’t as resilient.
Notably, constipation can have a big effect on quality of life; especially if it comes with one of the serious conditions above. Fortunately, there is a natural cure. Sufferers no longer have to be on a path to deteriorating health.
What You Can Do A majority of constipation medication are filled with chemicals which can harm the body, and make constipation worse. Even a product like Metamucil contains ingredients no person should consume, like aspartame.
Change your diet! This is one of the best ways to end constipation. Eat plenty of healthy fruits and vegetables and cut out processed foods as much as you can. Eating rancid fats (cooked meat) also doesn’t help with constipation and your digestive system so limiting that as much as possible is important.
There are also some great products on the market that can assist you in ending constipation while you spend time changing your diet over time. Wholey Shit is a great example as it contains only a few natural, high quality ingredients -and it works great! You can get a free sample of Wholey Shit here. 
These types of remedies are a great way to get started and relief naturally and quickly while you further discover how to adjust your diet and lifestyle to reflect better digestion, eating habits and so forth.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate panel probing alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election abruptly canceled an interview with President Donald Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen on Tuesday after he issued a statement about his testimony in violation of committee policy. “The committee expects witnesses in this investigation to work in good faith with the Senate,” Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr and Vice Chairman Mark Warner said in a statement after canceling the closed-door session. Cohen was later asked to appear at an open hearing on Oct. 25. Burr, a Republican, and Warner, a Democrat, said it was against the committee’s policy for witnesses to make public comments before being interviewed. The intelligence panel, other congressional committees and special counsel Robert Mueller are investigating whether Russia intervened to tilt the 2016 election in Trump’s favor and whether Trump or top aides colluded with Moscow. The Russian government denies any attempt to influence the election, and the Republican president has repeatedly denied any collusion, calling the investigations a “witch hunt.” The allegations have shadowed the first months of Trump’s presidency.  Two people familiar with the matter told Reuters that Trump was using money donated to his re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee to pay for his lawyers in the probe.  While previous presidential campaigns have used those funds to pay routine legal fees, Trump would be the first U.S. president in the modern campaign finance era to use them to cover the costs of responding to a criminal probe, election law experts said. In his statement, Cohen denied that he or Trump colluded with Russia to interfere in the election, and said such charges were made to discredit Trump’s presidency. “I emphatically state that I had nothing to do with any Russian involvement in our electoral process,” Cohen’s statement said. “Given my own proximity to the president of the United States as a candidate, let me also say that I never saw anything - not a hint of anything - that demonstrated his involvement in Russian interference in our election or any form of Russia collusion,” Cohen said. Cohen and his attorney, Stephen Ryan, had traveled to Capitol Hill for the closed-door interview with committee investigators, but were told the meeting had been postponed. “We didn’t want to send a message except for what we do is behind closed doors,” Burr later told reporters at the Capitol. The committee had changed its policy since Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, issued an 11-page statement before meeting with intelligence committee staff in July, he said. Asked if the committee would subpoena Cohen, Burr said he did not think it would need to. Cohen’s name surfaced in a dossier compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele that reported Cohen played an important role in liaison with the Russian government and secretly met with Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016. The Steele dossier, Cohen said in his statement, was “riddled with falsehoods and intentionally salacious allegations.” “I have never in my life been to Prague or to anywhere in the Czech Republic,” he said. Current and former U.S. intelligence officials have said that while they cannot verify all the details in the Steele dossier, neither have they debunked it entirely.    Former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman, Trump’s nominee to be ambassador to Russia, said at his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday: “There is no question, underline no question, that the Russian government interfered in the U.S. election last year.”  He pledged to bring up the issue with the government there. Huntsman previously served as U.S. ambassador to China under Democratic President Barack Obama.  ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"DURHAM, N. C.  —   As soon as Chris Rock strode onstage here on Monday in the first performance of his   “Total Blackout Tour,” he explained why, nine years after his last   special, he’s pacing stages again: “That’s what alimony will do to you. ” Mr. Rock, who was married for 16 years,  divorced last year, and while his quip had the jackhammer snap that has long made him the best deliverer of punch lines in comedy, the old swagger faded during his     show. Now 52, Mr. Rock, looking trim in casual black pants and jacket, talked about his vanity, insecurities and failures with startling frankness. “I wasn’t a good husband,” he said, standing still, shifting into a quieter register. “I didn’t listen. I wasn’t kind. I cheated. ” Mr. Rock paused as the audience waited for the joke. It arrived eventually, but it did not match the impact of this silent, dramatic beat. In his new set, Mr. Rock appeared to be after something more than laughs. It is rare to see a celebrity discuss his infidelity with the specificity that he did here  —   detailing who and how many  —   but he talked about this in an anguished, searching tone that fans may find surprising. At times, Mr. Rock sounded like a man confessing his sins, turning vulnerability into his latest provocation. Ever since his breakthrough 1996 HBO special, “Bring the Pain”  —   his new set includes giant initials evoking that seminal show  —   Mr. Rock has maintained a secure place in the   pantheon. But in contrast with peers like Bill Burr and Louis C. K. his specials are infrequent enough that every one is a major event. His current show will be released as a special on Netflix, part of a   $40 million deal. His last, “Kill the Messenger,” was recorded during the 2008 election, and it’s hard not to be struck by his cheerful mood then, sounding positively giddy as he pokes fun at John McCain, skewering him as a “war hero who got captured. ” In the recent presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump made the same point about Mr. McCain in similar language, but without the punch line. In the past nine years, the line for transgression has shifted. But Mr. Rock didn’t try to adjust to it. Nor did he approach the recent election with what has become the standard alarm of many comedians. Barack Obama was the anomaly, he argued, while Mr. Trump is a return to business as usual in a conservative country always run by rich white men. “I’m not scared,” Mr. Rock said, looking to the evils of history for comfort. “I’m black. The future is always better when you’re black. ” Comedy is about surprise, and one reason Mr. Rock has been his generation’s finest political   is his ability to consistently go against the grain with conviction. (Unlike some, he always seems to believe the premises of his jokes.) The rise of Mr. Trump, he concluded, taking his critique to a comic extreme, stems from our battle against bullying. “We got rid of bullies,” he said. “When a real one showed up, we didn’t know what to do. ” He also discussed police shootings in an unexpected way, saying that he would think that law enforcement might try to shoot a white kid for once, “just for appearances. ” But he also spent time sympathizing with police officers, describing work that has zero room for error and draws pay that is far too low. If his current social commentary has a common thread, it’s an alertness to how economics colors every issue. “Whole Foods does not say ‘No Blacks Allowed,’” he said. “But a $7 orange does. That’s the new Jim Crow. ” What stood out most about this show, however, was the personal, not the political. Mr. Rock has mostly kept the audience at a distance from his private life. He isn’t the type to dwell on his demons or soul search on a podcast. So it’s a surprise to see him tell jokes about the dark consequences of his addiction to pornography or the excruciating details of family court. This is not his funniest show, but it might be his most compelling, a departure even in its form. The distance between his forceful   persona and the   more thoughtful one he displays in interviews has shrunk a bit  —   and his jokes are more intricate, denser. What remains firm is a lyricist’s gift for concision, boiling down a thought to its comic essence. On bullying: “Pressure makes diamonds. Not hugs. ” Mr. Rock’s comedy has always been happily cynical about marriage, his jokes regarding relationships rooted in regressive stereotypes about men and women. He’s found many laughs in sympathy for men behaving badly, blaming Hillary Clinton for her husband’s cheating and pointing out how O. J. Simpson had to pay steep alimony while his former wife slept with another man. (“I’m not saying he should have killed her, but I understand. ”) When discussing his own marriage, however, he blamed only himself, repeatedly, allowing sadness to creep into his dynamic voice. He also dug into his past, telling a story about his grandmother disparaging poor men that stuck with him for years, and another about his grandfather mocking him for crying. Mr. Rock wants to tell us where he came from, and also where he hopes to go. “I’m trying to get a little bit of religion,” he said, before backtracking: “Not a lot. ” He added that he believes in God, but only a bit. Onstage, Mr. Rock has always had the intonations of a preacher  —   which his grandfather was  —   repeating premises until they sound like incantations. But his real religion is comedy, and at the end of this discussion of his relationship with God, he contrasted the sureness of faith with the questioning nature of a comic. But as comedians go, Mr. Rock has always been one of the most forcefully confident. What’s different is he now sounds more anxious. And while the election and his divorce may have added heaviness to his gait, this evolution may also stem from simply growing older. In a line he repeated over and over on Monday, Mr. Rock explained his spiritual search in the hardheaded pragmatic terms we’ve come to expect from him: “I want to find God before God finds me. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois must increase payments to Medicaid providers despite an ongoing budget impasse, after a U.S. District Court judge on Wednesday ruled the minimal payments made by the state do not comply with federal consent decrees.  Judge Joan Lefkow ordered renewed negotiations between Illinois and health care advocates for the poor, setting a June 20 deadline to be in “substantial compliance” with the decrees.     Lawyers representing the state’s 3 million Medicaid recipients had asked the judge to give precedence to payments to managed care organizations participating in the state and federal health care program for the poor and disabled over the state fully funding other priorities, including debt service on bonds and pensions.  Lefkow said Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who pays the state’s bills, has not offered a “lawful basis” for not paying the Medicaid providers the $2 billion they are owed. “Although the court means no disrespect to the comptroller, who faces an unenviable situation, it finds that minimally funding the obligations of the decrees while fully funding other obligations fails to comply not only with the consent decrees, but also with this court’s previous orders,” the judge’s latest order stated. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to a political stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Lawmakers ended their spring session on May 31 without a fiscal 2018 budget deal, triggering downgrades that pushed Illinois’ credit ratings from S&P and Moody’s Investors Service to a step above junk. As a result of the stalemate, Illinois’ backlog of unpaid bills reached $14.9 billion this week.  Mendoza said the real solution is enacting a budget.  “The lack of a budget for the last two years has created a situation in which we now have more court-ordered and state-mandated payments than we have revenues to cover them,” she said in a statement. Tom Yates, executive director of the Legal Council for Health Justice, who is representing Medicaid recipients in court, said more money is being sought at this time to ensure access to medical care, not an immediate payment in full. “I think the talks will have little different tenor now because the judge makes it pretty clear she expects more money to flow to Medicaid providers,” he said.  The consent decrees, which require the state to continue to make Medicaid payments despite its budget problems, stem from two 1992 cases.  ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump provoked a rare public dispute with America’s closest ally on Friday after his White House aired an explosive and unsubstantiated claim that Britain’s spy agency had secretly eavesdropped on him at the behest of President Barack Obama during last year’s campaign. Livid British officials adamantly denied the allegation and secured promises from senior White House officials never to repeat it. But a defiant Mr. Trump refused to back down, making clear that the White House had nothing to retract or apologize for because his spokesman had simply repeated an assertion made by a Fox News commentator. Fox itself later disavowed the report. The rupture with London was Mr. Trump’s latest quarrel with an ally or foreign power since taking office. Mexico’s president angrily canceled a White House visit in January over Mr. Trump’s proposed border wall. A telephone call with Australia’s prime minister ended abruptly amid a dispute over refugees. Sweden bristled over Mr. Trump’s criticism of its refugee policy. And China refused for weeks to engage with Mr. Trump because of his postelection call with Taiwan’s president. Mr. Trump’s strained relations with Europe, which has viewed his ascension to power with trepidation, were fully on display on Friday, not just in the British spy flap but also in the venue in which it was addressed. The president was hosting for the first time Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who is seen by many Europeans as the most important champion of the liberal international order. Though polite, the two leaders seemed stiff and distant during their public appearances. European news outlets and social media made much of the fact that she suggested a handshake for photographers in the Oval Office and he did not respond, although it appeared that he did not hear her. Either way, the two were clearly on separate pages on issues like immigration and trade. The angry response from Britain stemmed from Mr. Trump’s persistence in accusing Mr. Obama of tapping his phones last year despite the lack of evidence and    denials. At a briefing on Thursday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, read from a sheaf of news clippings that he suggested bolstered the president’s claim. Among them was an assertion by Andrew Napolitano, a Fox News commentator, that Mr. Obama had used Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters, the agency known as the GCHQ, to spy on Mr. Trump. In response to Mr. Spicer, the agency quickly denied it as “nonsense” and “utterly ridiculous,” while British officials contacted American counterparts to complain. “We said nothing,” Mr. Trump told a German reporter who asked about the matter at a news conference with Ms. Merkel. “All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didn’t make an opinion on it. ” He added: “You shouldn’t be talking to me. You should be talking to Fox. ” The president tried making a joke about it, turning to Ms. Merkel, who was angered during Mr. Obama’s administration by reports that the National Security Agency had tapped her cellphone and those of other leaders. “At least we have something in common, perhaps,” Mr. Trump said. She made a face that suggested she had no interest in getting involved. After the news conference, Mr. Spicer echoed Mr. Trump’s unapologetic tone. “I don’t think we regret anything,” he told reporters. “As the president said, I was just reading off media reports. ” Shortly afterward, Fox backed off Mr. Napolitano’s claim. “Fox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano’s commentary,” the anchor Shepard Smith said on air. “Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now president of the United States was surveilled at any time, any way. Full stop. ” Mr. Trump’s unremorseful tenor further stunned British officials, who thought they had managed to contain the matter. Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to the United States, had raised the matter on Thursday night with Mr. Spicer at a St. Patrick’s Day reception in Washington. Mark Lyall Grant, the national security adviser to Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, had contacted his American counterpart, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster. On Friday morning, a spokesman for Mrs. May said the White House had backed off the allegation. “We’ve made clear to the administration that these claims are ridiculous and should be ignored,” the spokesman said, on the condition of anonymity in keeping with British protocol. “We’ve received assurances these allegations won’t be repeated. ” But White House officials, who also requested anonymity, said Mr. Spicer had offered no regret to the ambassador. “He didn’t apologize, no way, no how,” a senior West Wing official said. The officials said they did not know whether General McMaster had apologized. The furor underscored the continuing troubles for the White House since Mr. Trump first accused Mr. Obama of tapping his phones, an allegation refuted by intelligence agencies as well as Republican and Democratic officials. Even as Mr. Trump refused to back down, fellow Republicans appeared increasingly irritated by what they see as a distraction from their policy goals. Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma said on Friday that Mr. Trump had not proved his case and should apologize to Mr. Obama. “Frankly, unless you can produce some pretty compelling truth, I think President Obama is owed an apology,” Mr. Cole told reporters. “If he didn’t do it, we shouldn’t be reckless in accusations that he did. ” The conspiracy theorizing also tested what is often called the special relationship between the United States and Britain. American intelligence agencies enjoy a closer collaboration with their British counterparts than any other in the world. GCHQ was the first agency to warn the United States government that Russia was hacking Democratic Party emails during the presidential campaign. Foreign policy analysts expressed astonishment that Mr. Trump would so cavalierly endanger that partnership. “It illustrates the extent to which the White House really doesn’t care what damage they do to crucial relationships in order to avoid admitting their dishonesty,” said Kori Schake, a former national security aide to President George W. Bush now at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. “America’s allies are having to protect themselves against being tarred with the White House’s mendacity. ” Eric S. Edelman, an under secretary of defense under Mr. Bush, has written about the stresses between the United States and Britain in recent years. “I hope that this latest episode doesn’t drive a stake through the heart of the strongest remaining element of   partnership,” he said. Julianne Smith, who was a deputy national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said Mr. Trump did not appear to realize how much American intelligence agencies depend on Britain in dealing with threats around the world. “He will probably live to see the day when he will regret firing off such an egregious insult to Britain and then failing to apologize for it,” she said. The issue clearly touched a nerve at GCHQ, which usually refuses to comment on intelligence matters. Its vehement response surprised British officials and analysts. Dominic Grieve, the intelligence committee chairman in Parliament, pointed to elaborate safeguards that prevent spying on the United States and require “a valid national security purpose” for any monitoring. “It is inconceivable that those legal requirements could be met in the circumstances described,” he said. Tim Farron, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the junior partner in the last British coalition government, described Mr. Spicer’s repetition of the claims as “shameful” and said Mr. Trump was “compromising the vital U. K. . S. security relationship to try to cover his own embarrassment. ” Downing Street evidently wanted to avoid adding to any embarrassment in Washington while making it clear that Britain had no part in any such wiretapping. But in rebuffing that effort, Mr. Trump showed that Mrs. May, who was the first foreign leader to visit the White House after his inauguration, may not have forged the bond she had hoped, analysts said. “It’s very easy to have a good meeting with Trump,” said Jeremy Shapiro, a former State Department official who is the research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations in London. “He’s very pleasant in person. He’ll promise you the world. And 48 hours later, he’ll betray you without a thought. He won’t even know he’ll be betraying you. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry  introduced a second batch of legislative proposals on Tuesday aimed at speeding up how the Pentagon buys weapons and making it easier for firms to retain their intellectual property. Thornberry’s legislation follows an initial batch of reforms enacted last year with the 2016 annual defense policy bill, and continues efforts to make weapons programs more transparent. The proposals are aimed at simplifying the convoluted U.S. Defense Department acquisition process, with a big push to fund more experimentation and prototyping of new weapons, while driving to get new technologies into the hands of troops faster. Many big weapons programs are over budget and behind schedule, although Pentagon officials say changes undertaken since 2009 are starting to have a positive impact. The new legislation aims to shorten the time it takes from the start of the design phase of a new program until a military service can start using a new weapon in combat to five-to-six years from around nine year currently, the staff said. The bill requires all weapons systems to have “open systems architectures” that will allow the services to hold competitions for more components, and carry out quicker upgrades as new technologies are developed. It authorizes the Air Force, Army and other military services to use certain funding to pay for prototype upgrades of components and to develop technology faster. The bill also seeks to end a controversy about how the Pentagon treats private companies’ intellectual property that has made non-traditional suppliers reluctant to do business with the U.S. military and its complex defense acquisition rules. Instead of automatically giving the government broad rights to control intellectual property rights that are jointly funded by industry and government, the bill would mandate that such arrangements would have to be negotiated between the parties. The legislation would also continue a push to make the military services more responsible and accountable for weapons programs, requiring them to begin overseeing milestone decisions for joint programs after Oct. 1, 2019. The bill also requires the secretary of defense, or his staff, to fix the costs and expected fielding date for new weapons programs, and then hold the services accountable for meeting those targets. To ensure more transparency, the bill also calls for creation of an acquisition scorecard that would compare program cost estimates with those submitted by independent estimators.

0,WELFake Dataset,"The latest trove of documents released by WikiLeaks includes thousands of pages of emails between John D. Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, and aides, Clinton family members and outside donors all angling for position and power within Mrs. Clinton’s   campaign. Last week, a set of Mr. Podesta’s emails were disclosed that included potentially damaging excerpts from private paid speeches Mrs. Clinton delivered to Wall Street executives in which she praised “open trade and open borders” and lamented that her personal wealth made her “kind of far removed” from the struggles of the middle class. The latest leaked emails show Mrs. Clinton’s campaign aides trying to grapple with that reality, and establish a campaign message that could position her, a career politician and Washington insider, as an appealing agent of change. The authenticity of the emails, which were from Mr. Podesta’s account, was not challenged by Glen Caplin, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton. Here are the highlights: Despite statements by Mrs. Clinton and her allies insisting she had not made up her mind about seeking the presidency in 2016, the emails reveal that her advisers had begun to test messages and contemplate a campaign strategy at least two years before she officially declared her candidacy in April 2015. Mr. Podesta, who would become campaign chairman, and Robby Mook, the eventual campaign manager, grappled with how to best position Mrs. Clinton, a career politician, as a change agent, how much to play up the   potential of her candidacy and how to address anger over income inequality. “Gender will be a big field and volunteer motivator, but it won’t close the deal,” Mr. Mook wrote to Mr. Podesta and Cheryl D. Mills, another Clinton adviser, in March 2014. “The real challenge,” Ms. Mills wrote, “is that this likely will be when people want experience and we got so burned by that narrative” in the 2008 campaign against Barack Obama that “we won’t go back to it, even though it might be right for now. ” The emails reveal the excruciating   behind every step related to how Mrs. Clinton handled everything from her splashy campaign rollout speech on Roosevelt Island in June 2015 to a single Twitter post. In one email chain from March 2015, four aides debated a Twitter post in which Mrs. Clinton would address for the first time revelations that she had used a private email server during her tenure at the State Department. “I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,” the post eventually read. “She smacked down POTUS on trade and kept kicking for a little bit,” Huma Abedin, a close aide, wrote on June 14, 2015, using an acronym for the president. “Worth looking at the transcript but this seemed to really work for this crowd. ” At the time, Mrs. Clinton was trying to craft herself as more of a populist, pointing to differences between her and Mr. Obama. The aides also liked the personal details she shared. “She inserted some new applause lines and talked about Dorothy,” her mother, “in a more personal way that I’ve only heard talk about privately,” Ms. Abedin wrote. Aides discussed leaking it after a meeting with labor leaders  —   so as not to undermine her “principled stand about not   the president in public. ” Mr. Mook suggested that Mrs. Clinton time her announcement to “help distract” from the barrage of criticism surrounding her use of a private email server. The emails show heightened awareness of her vulnerability to charges of   and political maneuvering. “She risks looking very political, especially on this,” wrote Joel Benenson, the chief strategist on the campaign. Mrs. Clinton’s press secretary, Brian Fallon, felt that leaking her new position on Keystone “might achieve the same effect of getting her on the record on this issue, but with less perception that she is putting a finger to the wind. ” We take a closer look at how the debate over the unveiling evolved. In 2015, the Clinton campaign had to deal with escalating chatter about a potential run by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Donors phoned in reports on Mr. Biden’s    maneuvers to advisers like Neera Tanden, who relayed them back to Mr. Podesta. Steve Elmendorf, a longtime Clinton supporter, emailed her campaign manager to grouse about one supporter in particular: Linda Lipsen, head of the trial lawyers association. “I get multiple   calls every morning and I try to talk everyone off the ledge and not bug u all,” Mr. Elmendorf wrote. “But Linda is in a different category. ” Ms. Lipsen had complained about not getting enough care from the campaign at a time when she was working members of her trade association and trying to keep them from considering Mr. Biden. For all the planning, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign aides appeared blindsided by the popularity of Senator Bernie Sanders’s populist message in the Democratic primary. Concern over Mrs. Clinton’s economic message seemed to reach a breaking point after Mrs. Clinton lost to Mr. Sanders by 22 percentage points in the New Hampshire primary. “Message needs to be more positive, upbeat, hopeful,” an adviser wrote to Mr. Podesta. “Bernie is saying we can change the world. Her msg is ‘No, we can’t’ because   …    ” The adviser expressed particular concern about young voters gravitating to Mr. Sanders’s promise for revolution. “Bernie’s ads feature young ppl saying why they are voting   supporting him,” she wrote. “Hillary’s ads need to be young people  —   all under 45 and a smattering of older ones  —   validating her. ” In January, Donna Brazile, a vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, passed on an email from Mr. Sanders’s   outreach team about how it was planning to host a   event. “Thank you for the heads up on this, Donna,” responded Adrienne Elrod, one of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign aides. Ms. Brazile, a longtime party operative, later replaced Debbie Wasserman Schultz on an interim basis as D. N. C. chairwoman on the eve of the party’s national convention, a change that came after leaked emails revealed that Democratic officials had conspired to harm Mr. Sanders’s bid for the party’s nomination. Her aides decided in January that she should avoid talking about Wall Street at an event in Nevada during her primary fight with Mr. Sanders. “Don’t know that it is most effective contrast for her,” wrote Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign’s communications director. “Seems like we are picking the fight he wants to have. ” In the fall and winter of 2011, an increasingly bitter dispute was breaking out between a top Clinton aide, Douglas J. Band, and Chelsea Clinton, over the blurred lines between the Clinton Foundation and Mr. Band’s consulting company, Teneo. Ms. Clinton had sought to reorganize and professionalize the foundation, angering Mr. Band and a fellow longtime Clinton aide, Justin Cooper, who resisted. “Doug apparently kept telling my dad I was trying to push him out, take over,” Ms. Clinton told Mr. Podesta in a November 2011 email. But the next month, Ms. Clinton was less understanding. In December, she emailed Mr. Podesta and several aides to Mrs. Clinton regarding a Clinton Foundation aide who worked for former President Bill Clinton. The aide, Ilya Aspis, had been calling members of Parliament in Britain “on behalf of President Clinton” for Teneo clients, including the chief executive of Dow Chemical. She also mentions that another former White House aide, Sara Latham, had begun working for Teneo but then quit “because she was so upset, partly because of what Doug and Declan asked her to   was happening for their clients at Davos. ” The reference appears to be to Declan Kelly, a   of Teneo, though what Ms. Latham was asked to do remains unclear.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

Case in point   Cheektowaga, New York lawmaker Angela Wozniak.This particular gem has now been forbidden to have interns after conducting an extramarital affair with one. After the young man, Elias Farah, shut the affair down, Wozniak began sexually harassing him. She also make his job a living hell, and kept him from attending and participating in events. After all of this came to light, a panel committee consisting of both Republicans and Democrats was formed to address this grossly and obviously improper conduct. Ultimately, it was decided that Wozniak was guilty of incredibly poor judgment  in conducting this affair and her behavior after it was over. There was, however, no way to prove on a legal level that Wozniak created a  hostile work environment  or sexually harassed Farah.Despite the lack of legal evidence, though, the investigating committee is now going to look into Wozniak s office every six months going forward. Also, her attempts to go after her accuser have luckily backfired, as she ironically ran for office after a Democratic opponent, Dennis Gabryszak, resigned over his own sexual scandal. A potential November Democratic opponent, sums up Wozniak s hypocritical behavior perfectly: She ran on a platform of family values based on the conduct of her predecessor. I hope to restore voters  confidence in their government and be a leader they can be proud of. And that is the problem with these holier than thou  family values  types. They make literal careers of condemning other people s lives and modes of living, all the while doing in private just what they preach against in public.No one would care if these people didn t try to pretend to be above the rest of us. But, since they do   good riddance to yet another  family values  hypocrite.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republicans on a U.S. House of Representatives panel said they were making progress on a Puerto Rico debt relief bill that will take the same basic approach as an earlier failed version, despite cancelling plans to unveil new legislation on Wednesday. The House Natural Resources Committee said more time was needed to refine the bill’s language. House Democratic leadership now expects legislation from the committee before the end of the week. Competing forces have fought over the bill and raised concerns that creditor rights and long-established municipal bond market hierarchy would be set aside in a broader plan to fix Puerto Rico’s festering debt problems that have resulted in a breakdown in the island’s social services. “The new bill itself already protects existing lawful creditor priorities and liens. The integrity of creditor hierarchy will be preserved,” said Parish Braden, spokesman for the Natural Resources Committee said on Wednesday. HNRC Chairman Rob Bishop told Reuters on Monday the bill is still expected to include the installation of an independent oversight board to lead the restructuring of the U.S. commonwealth’s credit and work with the local government to develop an economic reform plan. “The introduction (of the bill) is not being delayed due to the underlying foundation of the board,” Braden said, adding: “There aren’t hang ups. There are a number of refinements to the bill being made to ensure internal consistency among the titles (of the bill).”  One source familiar with the delay said it was due to a need to refine language related to the minimum wage and land-use issues over the island of Vieques. U.S. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday her party could not support the latest legislative effort but still hopes for an agreement within a few days. “We were disappointed that the bill we saw yesterday wasn’t something we could support, and so another few days of back and forth I think will produce something that we can take to the floor,” Pelosi told reporters. “I’m hoping maybe by Friday, so that we can have something for next week,” she added. Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its debt and faces an overall bill of $70 billion it cannot pay. A staggering 45 percent poverty rate and increased migration among its 3.5 million citizens to the U.S. mainland drains economic activity. The ranking Democrat on the HNRC issued a statement that said the families on the island needed relief from cuts to public services but remained hopeful a deal is close at hand. “We are making progress, but we are not there yet. The situation in Puerto Rico is dire, but a bill that doesn’t solve the problem, or doesn’t pass, won’t help anyone,” Raúl Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona said. Puerto Rico defaulted on May 1 for a third time on some of its debt, missing a roughly $400 million payment owed by the Government Development Bank, the island’s main fiscal agent. The May 1 default and the nearly $2 billion July 1 debt payments have spurred congressional activity. “(Senator Chuck) Schumer from the Senate is pushing to get something done. But the problem here is that Democrats are going to push for protections for unions and for pensioners and we feel like they should be at the bottom of the heap because that’s the way the law states,” Republican Representative John Fleming of Louisiana, a Tea Party favorite and member of the HNRC, told Reuters on Wednesday. “I think there’s just big divisions on how this goes. But I think the way it was previously set up, it’s not going to fly,” Fleming said. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

She begins by asking us wh... http://humansarefree.com/2016/10/severe-allergies-to-peanuts-eggs-and.html Have you read The Peanut Allergy Epidemic by historian Heather Fraser? She begins by asking us why the peanut allergy epidemic is only found in Western cultures, where at least 4 million people experience the mysterious phenomenon, yet there are virtually no reported cases in India, where peanuts just so happen to be the main ingredient in most baby food products. Consider this: one century ago, you couldn't find anyone allergic to peanuts, but now it's commonplace for parents to send EpiPens to school for the teacher and nurse to keep near to their children, just in case someone so much as opens a snack in the room that contains peanuts, or even if someone opens a food product that was so much as manufactured in ""a facility that processes peanuts."" What's wrong with the human body that it would go into anaphylactic shock from a seemingly harmless food ingredient that couldn't harm a soul a hundred years ago? Today, peanuts cause the most common severe food allergy reactions , and are the number one cause of death from food reactions, and for good reason: Peanut oil was never meant to be put in a syringe and injected into muscle tissue. Peanut oil is a non-stated, hidden ingredient in children's vaccines Back in 2010, one family had their 6-month-old child taken away from them and were accused in court of shaken baby syndrome, until their attorney presented corroborating medical information about the child's anaphylactic reaction and swelling around the baby boy's brain (subdural hemorrhages) that occurred as an immediate response to vaccinations . Which vaccines were those, you may be wondering? DTaP, Prevnar7 (pneumococcal) and Rotateq (Rotavirus vaccine). Guess what? The administered vaccines contained unlabeled peanut oil, which was used as an adjuvant, but was not listed on the vaccine inserts. The doctor basically proved to the court that the child's allergic reaction to having peanut oil injected by vaccine had caused the massive brain swelling reaction that sent the boy into shock. False medical theory: The stronger the allergic reaction to vaccine ingredients, the longer the immunity lasts In the mid-1960s, peanut oils were first introduced into vaccines because scientists hypothesized they could ""prolong"" immunity. Somehow, they thought, the oil would act as a time release capsule. Within 20 years, peanut oil was the preferred ""excipient"" – meaning a substance formulated alongside the active ingredient of a medication for the purpose of long-term stabilization. The dangers of its use, however, were well-documented. The problem ? Doctors and scientists had lumped immune response with immunity, making a grave mistake that's still assumed to be true today. The myth is that the greater the allergic response to the vaccine, the greater the immunity that is conferred. Wrong! Today, anyone who challenges this myth is referred to as anti-science, anti-vaccine and a conspiracy theorist. There is no faster way for a doctor to lose their license to practice medicine than to challenge this commandment of vaccine mythology. 1980 to 2016: Correlating the massive surge in severe childhood allergies When did these childhood allergies experience a massive upsurge in number? Answer: When the mandated schedule of the number and frequency of vaccines for children under age 7 doubled, and then tripled. Take a look: 1980 – 20 vaccines 1995 – 40 vaccines 2016 – 70 vaccines What's the easiest way to send a child's body into anaphylactic shock and create severe food allergies for the rest of his/her life? Inject intact proteins from peanuts, eggs and dairy (casein) products directly into the infant's muscle tissue 36 times before the age of 18 months. When normal food becomes extremely toxic to children, the parents should review how those specific ingredients have been introduced to their infant's bodies, and what other dangerous ""trace amounts"" of carcinogens, antibiotics, adjuvants, emulsifiers, preservatives, additives, brewing agents, carriers and ""immune response stimulants"" are being injected into the body repeatedly for no logical reason. Vaccines have never been proven safe or effective ; only studies done by the manufacturers themselves, which have subsequently been proven fraudulent, altered and skewed, are published in order to fool the public. Do you really know what's in most vaccines? Have you ever read the ingredients, warnings, reactions and the documented side effects on a vaccine insert? Here is a summary of the most dangerous vaccine ingredients, for your convenience: 1. Bovine cow serum: Extracted from cow skin. When injected causes connective tissue disorders, arthritis and lupus; also shortness of breath, low blood pressure, chest pain and skin reactions. 2. Sorbitol: Synthetic sweetener which metabolizes very slowly and aggravates IBS and gastrointestinal issues. 3. Hydrolyzed gelatin: Derived from the collagen inside animals' skin and bones. Injecting gelatin poses the risk of infection from synthetic growth hormones and BSE infectivity (mad cow disease). 4. Sodium chloride: Raises blood pressure and inhibits muscle contraction and growth. 5. Egg protein: Vaccines are prepared in eggs (certainly not organic). May contain growth hormones, antibiotics, and salmonella bacteria. 6. Casein: Also known as cow's milk protein, many children experience severe allergic and life-threatening reactions to traces of casein, commonly found in the DTaP vaccine. 7. Thimerosal: A neurotoxic mercury which causes autism: There are 25 mcg in one average flu vaccine, and the EPA safety limit is 5 micrograms, so children who are vaccinated simultaneously with multiple vaccines receive over 10 times the safety limit of mercury in one day. 8. Human albumin: The protein portion of blood from pooled human venous plasma; when injected causes fever, chills, hives, rash, headache, nausea, breathing difficulty, and rapid heart rate. 9. Formaldehyde: Highly carcinogenic fluid used to embalm corpses. Ranked one of the most hazardous compounds to human health; can cause liver damage, gastrointestinal issues, reproductive deformation, respiratory distress and cancer. Peanut oil? Enough said!

0,WELFake Dataset,"Warren, a hero of progressive Democrats, is the latest party leader to fall in line behind Clinton after she clinched the requisite number of delegates earlier this week over rival Bernie Sanders.

Warren told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow tonight, ""I am ready to get in this fight and work my heart out for Hillary Clinton to become the next president of the United States, and to make sure that Donald Trump never gets anyplace close to the White House.""

The endorsement comes the same day that President Obama also endorsed Clinton in a video and announced he would campaign with his former 2008 rival next week.

But Warren's backing may be more politically important for Clinton than Obama's blessing. The Democratic senator, who remained neutral throughout the contest, championed many of the same economic inequality issues and Wall Street reforms Sanders drew attention to in the primary.

She said tonight the 2016 election ""is not about one candidate, it's about all of us coming together coming together to fight to level the [economic] playing field.""

In fact, she was urged by many progressive groups early on to challenge Clinton herself, and the ""Ready for Warren"" organization who tried to lay the groundwork for her run ended up endorsing Sanders.

Even though she remained on the sidelines, Warren has emerged as a fierce attack dog against presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, calling him a ""nasty, thin-skinned fraud"" just Thursday. He, in return, has derided her as ""Pocahontas"" — an allusion to a controversy that emerged during her 2012 Senate run after she had claimed Native American ancestry.

Tonight Warren said Trump had cheered for the 2007 economic crisis because he knew how to make a profit from it. ""What kind of a person does that?"" she asked, ""an insecure money-grubber who cares about nothing but himself. ... That cannot be the man who leads the United States of America.""

Warren has been floated as a possible vice presidential pick for Clinton, a choice that could help allay some concerns among progressives about the former secretary of state's nomination.

But there was immediate backlash online to Warren's anticipated nomination. Many supporters took to her Facebook page with profane comments, calling her a ""sell out"" for not endorsing Sanders.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

The extreme Christian supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump present themselves as righteous holy rollers doing the work of God, but that is a ruse meant to disguise their true intentions of making women mere sexual pawns and exert patriarchal dominance over them. This fact was aptly pointed out by John Pavlovitz , a minister from Raleigh, North Carolina who published a scathing statement indicting all of the individuals who partake in this behavior. 
Pavlovitz attempted to spare no feelings when he warned women about Trump, his supporters, and how those individuals truly view a woman’s role in society: 
To them, you aren’t separate but equal, as they might claim from the pulpit. You may be made in the image of God, but not in the same way that they are. You are inferior. You are lesser than. You are Adam’s rib meat; baby machines, meal preparers, arm candy, pleasure tools designed by God for men to use as they desire. Some of these men of God will have the guts to actually say this, others will simply prove it to you. They are proving it to you now. Listen to them.” Pavlovitz says in their twisted patriarchal world, the men on the Christian Right think all men act like Trump, all men talk this way, all men think this way, but adds, “No, we don’t—but they do.” 
A line was drawn in the proverbial sand by Pavlovitz who harpooned the hypocrisy of Trump’s supporters. Trump claims to respect women, as do those who are in favor of his candidacy. Yet, that does not rationally follow for if it were true, and if these individuals did have respect for women, they’d dump Trump immediately: 
If these professed men of God truly acknowledged your inherent value, they would be fiercely defending you right now, instead of Donald Trump. They would be openly condemning such disregard for the image of God within you, and sharply severing their ties with him—but many of them they aren’t. They’re making excuses. They’re blaming the victim. They’re doubling down. They’re digging in their manly heels right now. 
The good minister pulled back the curtain to expose the sickening philosophy of these individuals. They care not about women as human beings, but consider them to be mere disposable objects to be used for their own nefarious purposes: 
The real reason they’re doing it, is because to them you aren’t worth defending; not your intelligence or your gifts or your worth. As a result, your consent isn’t really a concern either; you may have noticed that. It’s why, in their minds sexual misconduct almost never occurs, and when it does, it’s because you were dressed too provocatively or sending mixed signals, or because their motives were misinterpreted.They don’t believe you have the right to say or no or to be offended. If anything, they believe you should be flattered. This is the hubris of men who think God made you as an accessory. 
In an act of contrition and humility Pavlovitz apologized for the behavior of despicable men who behave as cowardly dogs. He stopped short of apologizing on the behalf of the men, as if he were their spokesperson: 
As a Christian and a pastor and a man, I’d liked to apologize to you for these men and what you endure from them, but I won’t apologize to you on their behalf because that would mean aligning myself with them and I will not do that. They don’t speak for me. They don’t speak for many of us. They certainly don’t speak for God. 
Minister John Pavlovitz’s statement is worthy of a resounding round of applause. As a man of the cloth he truly embodies the values which he espouses, which is a rare and precious trait in a society full of millions of individuals who support Trump and believe that his word is the gospel. It is truly disheartening and frightening to know that while all citizens in the United States have the same rights, and all votes are equal, that so many would use those votes in a way which is detrimental to the lives of their fellow female citizens.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

Anspach (@JayseDavid) April 10, 2017Many readers on our 100 Percent FED UP Facebook page were enraged to think that we would even suggest that there could be more to the story than what was being reported. We were curious about what happened before Dr. Dao was dragged out of his seat. To be clear, we don t condone the abuse of any passenger on a paid flight by airport police, but we still believed there was more to the story than what was being shown in a video making the rounds on social media, that was taken by a passenger on the flight from Chicago to Louisville.We re wondering how long the United Airlines passengers would have put up with Dr. Dao s refusal to leave the plane before they became involved. After 1 or 2 hours of Dr. Dao s refusal to leave (even though he accepted to those terms when he agreed to fly with United), would the passengers have taken matters into their own hands after hours of listening to him refusing to leave? How long would the passengers have allowed Dr. Dao to delay their flight before demanding someone take action?Here s the latest UPDATE:The tense moment Dr David Dao argued with a Chicago cop just seconds before being humiliatingly hauled off an overbooked United Airlines flight has been captured on camera.Footage of Dr Dao being unceremoniously dragged from a plane at Chicago O Hare International Airport on Sunday has traveled around the world, leading to mass condemnation of United and its policies.But exactly what happened in the moments leading up to the doctor being pulled from the fight by his arms was unknown.Until now.The new video, recorded by a female passenger sitting directly behind Dr Dao, starts with a flight attendant and police officer standing in the aisle.The doctor is seen gesturing with his arm towards the cop, while talking on his cellphone. I won t go. I m a physician I have to work tomorrow, eight o clock,  he is heard saying.Dr Dao then tells the person he is talking to on the phone:  I  I tell you  make a lawsuit against United Airlines. The officer is then heard in the video again asking Dr Dao to leave. No I am not going,  he replies, shaking his head angrily.The cop then says:  Well  I have to drag you  You know how this is going to end up happening, right? Dao then replies:  You can drag me, I m not going. I m staying right here. You ll have to drag me. The cop then says,  I m just telling you, it s going to be a lot harder for you , before Dao interrupts with:  Yes I know that, I d rather go to jail. You d rather go to jail than just getting off,  the cop replies, while sounded confused at the comment. Yes,  Dao is heard saying.The two then continue speaking for a few more seconds, with Dr Dao mentioning he had flown to Chicago from Los Angeles and was desperate to get home, before the video cuts off.Here s the video:  Daily Mail",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday stepped up his war of words over National Football League players’ silent protests against racial injustice, saying the world’s top-grossing sports league should not be given tax breaks while athletes kneel during the national anthem. The NFL gave up its tax-free status two years ago, but new or renovated stadiums are often funded at least in part by tax-exempt municipal bonds issued by local governments or states. Team owners benefit from government financing via lower interest rate bonds backed by team lease payments, stadium-generated revenue and even tax dollars.  The administration could push for changes to the laws that allow professional sports teams to enjoy tax breaks normally aimed at city governments. Below are five facts about the financing of sports stadiums. 1) Laws allowing teams to fund stadiums with tax-exempt bonds have cost the United States $3.7 billion in lost tax revenue from 2000 through 2014, according to a Brookings Institution paper released last year, a figure that reflects the lower interest rates paid on municipal debt and the tax exemption for bondholders. 2) Of the 16 NFL stadiums built or renovated from 2000 through 2014, 13 were financed in part by tax-exempt bonds with an average financing worth $360.2 million, according to Brookings, a Washington-based policy think tank. 3) Trump could propose tax reform legislation to remove the federal tax exemptions on debt financing for stadiums. However federal changes would not necessarily hinder any potential incentives offered by state and local authorities. The latest and largest subsidy offered to an NFL franchise is the $750 million Las Vegas is using to lure the Oakland Raiders to a $1.9 billion stadium. The money will come from public funds raised via a visitors’ tax on Las Vegas strip hotel rooms. 4) There are two bipartisan bills, one in the Senate and one in the House, before the U.S. Congress that seek to remove federal tax exempt status for bonds tied to sports stadiums by treating them as private activity bonds. 5) Former U.S. President Barack Obama proposed in two previous budgets for 2015 and 2016 legislation to eliminate the tax exemptions on stadium financing, Brookings said.

0,WELFake Dataset,"BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - European countries are scrambling to cobble together a package of measures they hope will keep the Iran nuclear deal on track if U.S. President Donald Trump ignores their pleas and decertifies the landmark 2015 agreement this week. The package would include a strong statement backing the deal by European powers, together with efforts to lobby the U.S. Congress and put wider pressure on Iran, officials said. But without strong U.S. support for the deal, senior officials in Berlin, Paris and London say it may be only a matter of time before the pact between Tehran and six world powers unravels, with grave consequences for Middle East security, nonproliferation efforts and transatlantic ties. The two-year-old agreement, under which Iran agreed to freeze its nuclear program for 15 years in exchange for sanctions relief, is viewed in Europe as a rare triumph of international diplomacy in the Middle East. As tensions over North Korea s nuclear activities risk boiling over into all-out war, any move by the United States to undermine the Iran deal is seen in Europe as utter folly. European capitals have been delivering this message to the White House and Congress in one of the most intense lobbying campaigns in recent memory. In the past weeks, European ambassadors have met dozens of U.S. lawmakers. And on Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May lobbied Trump by phone. Despite this, Trump is expected declare this week that Iran is not complying with the pact. He is also due to unveil a tough new strategy toward Iran - including designating its Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization - that could sink the deal.  If the feeling is the United States no longer supports the agreement then the political reality is that the deal will be in serious jeopardy and its implementation will be very difficult,  a senior French diplomat told Reuters. A decision by Trump to decertify would not automatically kill the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The expectation is that Trump would kick the ball to Congress, which would then have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions lifted as part of the JCPOA. THREE-PRONGED RESPONSE European officials said they were preparing a three-pronged strategy if this does occur. First, Berlin, London and Paris would issue statements reaffirming their commitment to the deal. Second, they would redouble efforts to lobby Congress, which appears keen to keep the deal, against any rash moves. And third, they would present measures to pressure Iran over its ballistic missile program and destabilizing policies in the Middle East   areas that fall outside the narrowly-focused nuclear deal. French President Emmanuel Macron alluded to this at the United Nations last month. Diplomats said the package was still in the works and they had not yet briefed Brussels on it. With the third step, the Europeans hope to build a bridge to Washington while keeping the JCPOA intact. But a German diplomat said ratcheting up pressure on Tehran was like walking a tightrope: push too hard and the whole deal could fall apart.  We all knew the JCPOA wasn t perfect, but by calling its benefits into question I see us only losing,  said a senior European diplomat who has been involved in negotiations with Iran since 2003, well before Washington joined the talks under President Barack Obama.  If Trump follows through on his threats it will be the second time in four months that he has distanced the United States from a major multilateral agreement despite intense lobbying by partners and members of his own cabinet. But in Europe, the Iran move would be seen as far more damaging than Trump s decision in June to pull out of the Paris climate accord.  The threat from Iran in terms of nuclear proliferation is more immediate. This is far more dangerous,  said Elmar Brok, a veteran foreign policy expert in the European Parliament and party ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. European officials and analysts fear a breakdown of the JCPOA could lead to an arms race in the Middle East, a military conflict between Iran and Israel and an escalation of regional proxy wars between Iran and Saudi Arabia. They fear it would also doom any chances, no matter how slim, for a negotiated deal with North Korea.  At the end of the day it s all about the risk of war,  said Francois Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. There is also the danger of a further deterioration in transatlantic ties, especially if Washington targets European firms that do business in Iran. Were that to happen, the EU ambassador to Washington, David O Sullivan, has said Brussels would revert to a 1990s-era law that shields European companies from extraterritorial sanctions. Even if the EU were to take such a step, the senior French diplomat said European companies could think twice about their Iran commitments. Among firms that have announced big deals in Iran since the JCPOA went into force are planemaker Airbus, French energy group Total and Germany s Siemens.  One of the big difficulties of the agreement is ensuring the economic operators have confidence in the system and key to that is confidence in the United States,  the diplomat said. Any signs that European companies are pulling back could prompt the Iranians to reassess the merits of the nuclear deal.  The agreement with Iran is like a delicate plant,  said Omid Nouripour, an Iranian-born lawmaker with the German Greens party, which is expected to be part of Merkel s next coalition government.  It is a sign of what diplomacy can achieve but it is fragile. The American president doesn t appear to believe in diplomacy. He seems intent on crushing this plant.

0,WELFake Dataset,"  Without intention, Mike kind fulfills the proverb that not all who wander are lost. A 1973 graduate of the College of the Holy Cross with a BA in Philosophy, he had successfully dodged the draft during Vietnam, despite his lottery number of 29. Logically, after failing at being a bum for a year after college, he then enlisted in the Army. His theory was to hang out for two years, go to Germany, date blondes, drink lots of beer, improve his wretched German and come home to use the GI Bill for Graduate School. Didn’t quite work out that way; he did go to Germany and stayed five years first tour; married a red-headed American GI who worked in S2; did drink lots of beer and developed some acuity with pidgin Deutsch. Mike re-enlisted and then wandered through a great 23 years as a soldier. A lot of it sucked, of course; but, he avoided ending his adolescence until the end of the 23 years…since then, he’s been in a fight to regain that feeling of camaraderie, purpose and trust. Mike chose to stay a career NCO. There were a couple of dozen reasons, but they’re best summed up by the fact that he really didn’t like officers. He still doesn’t, sheepishly at times admitting that “Some of my best friends are officers. Some of my best friends are gay. Some of my best friends are gay officers. I’m not gay and I’m not an officer – I like it better that way.” He got his initial First Sergeant assignment in his 14th year and basically stayed a First Sergeant until he retired, as a First Sergeant. If he hadn’t retired, the day after the retirement would have been the day he pinned on CSM stripes but, as he says, “Some of my best friends are Sergeant Majors; some of my best friends are hookers. I’m not a Sergeant Major and I’m not a hooker and that works fine for me.” Since retiring, Mike’s worked in Labor Relations, HR and General Management for government, tribes, nonprofits and for profits including Defense Contractors. He’s found that his “not being a hooker” approach hasn’t necessarily worked to his career advantage. He’s picked up a bunch of irrelevant graduate degrees, that basically were there to teach you how to be a Hobbit. Hobbits are small, insignificant fearful types who scurry around getting in the way and accomplishing nothing of any great merit. He believes that the movies would have been infinitely better had the bad guys killed off all the Hobbits in the first part of the first movie, and then spent the rest of it avenging the little twits. Mike really hates Hobbits He’s a Senior Professional in Human Resources and a Six Sigma Black Belt. He plays guitar, reads, broods and drives too fast in fast cars – currently, a Mustang GT – channeling Hunter S. Thompson, patrolling “on the edge of the desert, just outside of Barstow.” An avowed leftist and philosophical Stoic, Mike admits that everything is probably going to hell, but thinks that it’s the duty of people of honor to work to stop it from going there too quick. Since he regards all veterans as his extended family, he expects that they’ll do the same. An oddly religious guy, Mike believes that God is a not very bright, self—entered and hormonal teenage girl obsessed with the Jonas Brothers and whether or not her Daisy Duke jeans make her ass look fat. They do, but he’s not going to be the one to tell her the truth. God can’t handle the truth. While he might write about anything, he’s really interested in business, economics and how to keep people from being screwed by machines, be they corporate, government, or societal. He's also interested in guitars... Dispatches from Wolf Country –Sitting in my cave, watching the spider spin By Mike Farrell on November 9, 2016 I didn't think much of Donald Trump.

As the election slogs on to the end, I’ve been relatively quiet. There was a lot to digest, a lot to think about. Obviously not in the election campaigns; they’ve been short of thought. But the implications of the demographic change in the USA, the failure of our education system, the stubbornness of entrenched wealth, and the lack of intellectual vibrancy, integrity and should provide a lot things to think about going forward. The Trump experience is going to be with us for a long time. What other people — historians, political scientists, theologians, journalists, and leaders — call American Constitutional Democracy, he condemns as a rigged system. As Bill Mahar has pointed out frequently, “When is a rich white guy in this country going to get an even break!” In an odd way, it’s true — in any contest against the rich white guys, the odds for them are always 60-40; for the rest of us, that means our odds are 60-40 against. Well, the early 20th century with Wilson Minzer contended pretty successfully that in life, the odds are always 60-40 against. I think that’s hell of an advantage people like Trump have to screw up just to face the same odds most of us face in getting through life. The thing in this election that will probably make the difference is that sometimes wealth is money, sometimes it’s access to media, and sometimes it’s something else. In this election, it’s something else. Farrell, November 6, 2016 

And then, boys and girls, I turned away from the computer because I realized that I wasn’t sure what it was that I wanted to say. Like a lot of folks from the Northeast who paid attention to New York City, I didn’t think much of Donald Trump. I still don’t — I think he’s a vulgar, crooked, misogynistic, racist, elitist, intellectually stunted, narcissistic, naive and utterly unprepared to be president. I think Mike Pence is a right wing troll. The thought of Newt Gingrich as Secretary of State and Rudy Giuliani as Secretary of State and Attorney General makes my skin crawl. 
Well, that’s fine. I voted, and had my say. Now I have to deal with a reality as a responsible citizen and patriot. Like it or not, we have to be adult about this. I think the best advice ever for an actual American who cares about his country and what it stands for was given by Marion Mitchell Morrison, better known as John Wayne, the week after the election in 1960. 
Progressives would regard Wayne as a Wingnut. He was a Goldwater Republican and a fierce patriot. He defined manhood for a couple of generations of boys and men; it’s an image that defined manhood for a lot of people. His characters weren’t him; he wasn’t his characters, but I think he was inspired by a lot of them to be something more than he was. He pushed himself to be something more than he was. He had a lot of warts, but ultimately he faced them, wore them and didn’t let them get in his way. I’m not sure who the equivalent character would be in cinema today — George Clooney? It’s actually pretty simple, there is known. I suspect it’s probably Bruce Springsteen for a lot of people, because of the impact of rock and roll on my generation and those that follow it. 
Wayne was asked what he thought about Kennedy’s election and Nixon’s defeat. His response was simple, straight and honest. I didn’t vote for him but he’s my president, and I hope he does a good job. –John Wayne 
That quote is fairly well known and often quoted, usually by progressives pointing out the problems with Conservative Obstruction and totally absurd complaints. That use has been justified. But, a lesser known quote from the Duke on the inauguration of Jimmy Carter is worth considering now. 
I’m pleased to be present and accounted for in this capital of freedom to witness history as it happens – to watch a common man accept the uncommon responsibility he won ‘fair and square’ by stating his case to the American people – not by bloodshed, be-headings, and riots at the palace gates. I know I’m a member of the loyal opposition – accent on the loyal. I’d have it no other way. John Wayne, Washington, DC. January 20, 1977 
So, President Trump, as did President Obama, will have a unique opportunity to do something. I do not think Trump has the temperament and the knowledge to be a great president but like Wayne, what the hell do I know? He isn’t a politician and he hasn’t worked in government. I suspect he’s in for a steep learning curve. I hope he has the wisdom to find some people to advise him who have that kind of experience so that he can be successful. 

Like it or not, the election shows that we are in fact a badly divided commonwealth. There’s little agreement across party lines on a wide variety of things. Some of those things are ontological — what’s the nature of truth? How important is it? Does logic matter as much, more or less than emotion? What are the limits of discourse in public? What constitutes unreasonable insult and what constitutes reasonable epithet? How do you deal with disagreement? How do you discuss policy? How do you deal with the political problems caused by economic and demographic change? 
It’s going to be interesting. President Trump has to satisfy his supporters while reconciling with those who oppose him. Since a lot of his supporters are conditioned to envy, mistrust and despise the rich bastards and Gatsby types — sound like anyone we know? — and a lot of his opponents are inclined to to distrust, despise and want restitution for his victory, it’s going to be a Herculean task for the guy to get them to agree on whether to order chicken, hamburgers or fish at a team building retreat, let alone actually do anything. 
I have to think that President Obama has had an interesting morning as well. Trump doesn’t have majorities like Obama had in Congress in 2009 and has a somewhat more disgruntled electorate. While I’m sure Obama may be tempted to short sheet the beds and put Icy Hot on the toilet seats in the Executive Mansion, I suspect he’ll be gracious and do whatever he can to assist President Trump to a smooth and reasonable transition. 
I think Lincoln had the best advice for all of us as this unfolds. Be nice if we could agree to it and be scored against it. With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations. — Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural, March 4, 1865",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"That dreadful night in Benghazi, Libya in September of 2012 when the lives of four Americans were lost will be one that we shall never forget. We shall never forget it for two reasons: because of the tragedy that occurred and the loss of life, and because Republicans and Fox News insist that there was some sort of wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in her reaction to events that took place.Clarifying one of the longest held myths by Fox News and conservatives, Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta spoke to MSNBC s Andrea Mitchell. Not only did he debunk the myth of a  stand down  order so many on the right like to claim was said in an effort to prove Hillary as uncaring and incompetent, but he also explained how everything that could have been done, was done.Mitchell first asks Panetta about some existing circulating theories about that dreadful night in Benghazi:Now you re here in Washington because you re going to be testifying to the Benghazi Select Committee tomorrow. You have already testified to other committees, but to this committee, and there s a new movie coming out, 13 Hours, and it s about to be released. It is accusing the CIA operatives on the ground of being ordered to stand down and not go to the rescue in time. And the suggestion is that, if not for that order to stand down, that Chris Stevens and the others might have been saved. First of all, you were at the Pentagon at the time, I believe. Was there any order to stand down that you know of?Panetta responds:Absolutely not. You know, I m sure there are going to be movies and books and there will be all kinds of theories that will be presented, but from my experience, and from the role that I played as secretary of defense, there was never any order to stand down. On the contrary, the whole effort was to do everything possible to try to save lives.Delving further into if there were any sort of Hillary Clinton misstep, Mitchell asks if there were any sort of  stand down  order:There s also a report, several reports, that the Pentagon made an offer of a rescue effort, military effort to the State Department, and that someone, the suggestion is Hillary Clinton, said,  no thanks, we don t need the help or stand down or stand back.  Was there any effort by the Pentagon to intervene that the State Department rejected and would she have even been in the role?Panetta offers an answer that many right-wingers are not going to like whatsoever, the truth:I m not aware of any such effort at all. As a matter of fact, after meeting with the president, I immediately went back and we made decisions to deploy forces, to put them in place to be able to go in and provide help to those involved, and we in fact put forces in place. The problem was that [the] attack ended quickly and because of time and distance we never had a chance to get there. This is a tragic event. It s tragic in a number of ways. But most importantly, it s tragic because it s now become a political football that unfortunately, I think, doesn t do service to all of those that were committed to trying to protect lives.Panetta is exactly right. This tragedy has become even more tragic by how it has been wrongfully perpetuated by conservatives to try to score political points against Hillary Clinton. We need to learn from what happened in Benghazi and make sure it never happens again. We also need to, once and for all, put the myth to bed that Hillary was incompetent. She, of all people, is quite aware of the loss that happened that day. She s also one of the best qualified to make sure it never happens again.

0,WELFake Dataset,"(Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday he would name retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The following is a list of Republican Trump’s selections for top jobs in his administration. All the posts but that of national security adviser require Senate confirmation: Mattis is a retired Marine Corps general known for his tough talk, distrust of Iran and battlefield experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. A former leader of Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia, Mattis, 66, is known by many U.S. forces by his nickname “Mad Dog.” He was once rebuked for saying in 2005: “It’s fun to shoot some people.” Mnuchin, 53, is a relatively little-known but successful private equity investor, hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002. He assembled an investor group to buy a failed California mortgage lender in 2009, rebranded it as OneWest Bank and built it into Southern California’s largest bank. The bank came under fire for its foreclosure practices as housing advocacy groups accused it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Ross, 78, heads the private equity firm W.L. Ross & Co. His net worth was pegged by Forbes at about $2.9 billion. A staunch supporter of Trump and an economic adviser, Ross has helped shape the Trump campaign’s views on trade policy. He blames the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which entered into force in 1994, and the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization for causing massive U.S. factory job losses. Chao, 63, was labor secretary under President George W. Bush for eight years and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. Chao is a director at Ingersoll Rand, News Corp and Vulcan Materials Company. She is married to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: U.S. REPRESENTATIVE TOM PRICE Price, 62, is an orthopedic surgeon who heads the House of Representatives’ Budget Committee. A representative from Georgia since 2005, Price has criticized Obamacare and has championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts and lawsuit reforms to replace it. He is opposed to abortion. U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY Haley, a 44-year-old Republican, has been governor of South Carolina since 2011 and has little experience in foreign policy or the federal government. The daughter of Indian immigrants, Haley led a successful push last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston by a white gunman. DeVos, 58, is a billionaire Republican donor, a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and an advocate for the privatization of education. As chair of the American Federation for Children, she has pushed at the state level for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for the expansion of charter schools.  Sessions, 69, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump’s presidential bid and has been a close ally since. The son of a country-store owner, the senator from Alabama and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  Carson, 65, is a retired neurosurgeon who dropped out of the Republican presidential nominating race in March and threw his support to Trump. A popular writer and speaker in conservative circles, Carson previously indicated reluctance to take a position in the incoming administration because of his lack of experience in the federal government. Carson is the first African-American picked for a Cabinet spot by Trump. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: RETIRED LIEUTENANT GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN Flynn, 57, was an early supporter of Trump and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. He began his U.S. Army career in 1981 and served deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flynn became head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012 under President Barack Obama, but retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of Obama’s foreign policy. Pompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency and cyber security. A retired Army officer and Harvard Law School graduate, Pompeo supports the U.S. government’s sweeping collection of Americans’ communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran.

0,WELFake Dataset,"The National Fraternal Order of Police knows exactly what the President-elect s values are and knows it s a massive advantage in its quest to return America to a less progressive time.With full knowledge that Donald Trump does not give a damn about minorities and is in full support of profiling African Americans and Hispanics, the National Fraternal Order of Police has called on Trump to reverse or amend the broad, Bush-era ban on racial profiling. The ban on racial profiling has been around since 2003, when President George W. Bush created guidelines that prevented federal agents from factoring race or ethnicity in investigations. Now, the Fraternal Order of Police is acting to reverse that ban, as its website states that racial profiling is a  statistical disparity  and that the current ban burdens  law enforcement agency to somehow prove itself innocent of engaging in the unlawful use of race in its procedures and practices.  The organization also doesn t like that the ban is meant to protect racial and ethnic minorities,  which they feel is  excluding members of other races. While the proposed lifting of the ban is absolutely ridiculous, it becomes truly scary when you consider that Trump himself has implied that he is in favor of racial profiling. It was only a few months ago, in September, when Trump said that police forces needed more leniency when it comes to investigating people based on their race. Trump said: Our local police   they know who a lot of these people are. They are afraid to do anything about it because they don t want to be accused of profiling.They see somebody that s suspicious, they will profile. Look what s going on: Do we really have a choice? We re trying to be so politically correct in our country, and this is only going to get worse. Apparently, Trump is oblivious to the fact that there have been various studies proving that racial profiling is ineffective and may actually be counterproductive. Of course, the National Fraternal Order of Police has accurately identified Trump as their guy. They not only supported him during his campaign, but noted his  real commitment to law enforcement.  The organization s president, Chuck Canterbury, said: Mr. Trump, however, has seriously looked at the issues facing law enforcement today. He understands and supports our priorities and our members believe he will make America safe again. Featured image via Drew Angerer / Getty Images",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

Before that game, as Bennett has the entire preseason, he sat during the national anthem in protest against police brutality nationwide. Number 72 has been an outspoken activist for years, but this year he has elected to actually join other players in protest of the treatment of people of color at the hands of police.As he did previous 2 weeks, Michael Bennett sits during national anthem.

With a statement far too large to fit into even a series of tweets, Bennett posted his account of what happened after the much-hyped fight between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor in Las Vegas on August 26th:To be clear, Michael Bennett is a very big man. At six-foot-four and 275 pounds of pure muscle, Bennett wears a smaller version of standard NFL shoulder pads so they don t get in his way as he crushes his opponents on the field. But this beast of a man, compliant in every way, finally encountered something that made him fear for his life: The police.Any Seahawks fan   and I am one of the biggest   will tell you that Michael Bennett is the last person that would ever be a suspect in any kind of violent crime. If he seems like a monster when he gears up, it is in polar opposite to his life off the field. He lives in Hawaii with his wife and three young daughters. His brother Martellus, a tight end for the Packers, writes children s books. Michael collaborates with his brother s business, The Imagination Agency. He is a happy man.But today he is not happy. If NFL fans thought they were going to get players to stop protesting during the national anthem by complaining about their patriotism, they should seek out Michael Bennett and ask him how much he loves this country. Bennett is a proud American, standing up against the police brutality that has claimed so many young black lives, and almost claimed his own.Featured image via Elsa (Staff)/Getty Images",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"A new poll released from ABC/Washington Post shows some very good news for Democrats: not only is Hillary Clinton crushing Donald Trump, but President Obama s approval rating has hit a five year high   topping off at 56 percent of people who approve of him   a five point gain from the last poll conducted. Only 41 percent disapprove.The last time President Obama s approval rating was that high was when Osama bin Laden was killed in May 2011. It s also worth noting that the President s approval rating was taken in the immediate aftermath of the Orlando shooting, the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.But wait, there s more good news: not only does 56 percent of the American electorate approve of President Obama s presidency overall, 55 percent approve (42 disapprove) of his handling of the economy. Considering Trump likes to paint himself as the  best  man to handle the economy, the news should offer him and his campaign a much needed wake up call.As the Post noted:Obama is more popular now than Republicans George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush in the waning months of their presidencies. Although Obama s approval rating has not reached the level of former Democratic president Bill Clinton s in 2000, his standing suggests that he could be a relatively effective surrogate for Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.Just think about it   Clinton already has a huge lead over Trump, and that s before the very popular President Obama has hit the campaign trail. Once Americans see what will be leaving and what might be succeeding them, one could expect to see not only Clinton s poll numbers to rise, but Obama s as well.So what say you, Republicans? A healthy majority of Americans support the president and loathe your candidate. I don t think Republicans get to talk about the  will  of the American people anymore. They have no ground to stand on, no leverage, and no one seems to be taking them seriously anymore.President Reagan s final year approval high was 65 percent, just nine points higher than President Obama s. The President still has six more months, and considering how unpopular Donald Trump is becoming, America should expect to see it climb higher.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

The Syrian army, backed by Russian air power, Shi ite militias supported by Iran and local fighters from the Druze sect have besieged the rebel enclave around Beit Jin for weeks. In recent days it captured various positions, leaving the rebels trapped inside the town itself.  There is now negotiation on the departure of fighters and those who wish to leave with them,  said Abu Kanaan, an official in a local rebel group.  The militias are trying to convince them to evacuate to Idlib... There has been no agreement reached yet,  said Ibrahim al-Jebawi, an official with a Free Syrian Army faction familiar with the situation.  Syria s army and its allies have increasingly pushed for such evacuation deals for rebel enclaves near big cities or in other strategic locations after long periods of siege and bombardment.  The area around Beit Jin is sensitive because of its location next to the Israel-controlled Golan Heights.  Israel wants to keep Lebanon s Hezbollah, the most powerful of the Iran-backed militias aiding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against the rebel groups, far away from its border with Syria.  It has repeatedly targeted military positions in Syria near the border after stray projectiles crossed into Israeli-controlled areas, and it has struck Hezbollah convoys and weapons caches inside Syria.

I’m going to do everything that I can to keep my colleagues interested enough to want to fight to see exactly what happened. Because I believe that there was a connection between Donald Trump’s campaign and the Russians and the Kremlin. And I do believe that those connections are there for a reason. And I think that the work that has already been discovered, that was done, in order to have Trump, should be followed up. We shouldn’t say  —   let our intelligence agency say, yes we discovered that the DNC was hacked, and that efforts were made to help Trump in this campaign and to undermine Hillary Clinton, and that’s it. We don’t have to do anything else. No, this is serious and I think that we must continue this struggle to dig deeper, to drill deeper. ” She continued, “I think there is a trail, and I think that the Obama administration has done everything that it can possibly do, and that’s probably been verified somewhat by the New York Times, to make sure that enough people have seen some of the meetings and some of the connections, so that they have something to go on when the investigations are really underway. ” Waters added, “What we know is that, we can’t trust the AG. We can’t trust the FBI. We can’t trust Comey. We can’t trust Sessions, and so, we’ve got to get an independent overseer of some kind in here to get going with these investigations. ” (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

Though their private meeting at the G-20 summit was supposed to last a half hour, Trump ended up spending two hours and sixteen minutes with the man who helped him get elected through a fierce and well-funded propaganda campaign as well as an extensive hacking effort. Several times I had to remind the president, people were sticking their heads in the door,  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the Washington Examiner.

There was so much to talk about,  said Tillerson.  Neither one of them wanted to stop. Tillerson says that Trump and Putin got along like they had been best friends all their lives. The two leaders connected very quickly,  he says.  There was a very clear positive chemistry. Don t worry, though. Trump is on top of this Russia scandal thing. He asked Vlad if Russia interfered with our election and accepted at face value that Putin absolutely did not help him win.  Nothing to see here:Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who attended the meeting along with Tillerson, said Trump accepted Putin s assurances that Russia didn t meddle in the U.S. election. But Tillerson said the Russians had asked for  proof and evidence  of its involvement. A day earlier, Trump had said Russia probably meddled but that other countries likely did, too.Tillerson said the two leaders had agreed to continue the discussion, with an eye toward securing a commitment that Russia won t interfere in U.S. affairs in the future.See?

0,WELFake Dataset,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton played it strictly deadpan while parrying decidedly off-the-wall questions from comedian Zach Galifianakis on his online parody talk show, “Between Two Ferns,” released on Thursday.  Galifianakis, star of “The Hangover” films, is known for his cringe-inducing banter on the web program, asking subjects awkward questions. Past interview subjects include Brad Pitt, Charlize Theron, Bradley Cooper and President Barack Obama. Sitting between two fern plants on a sparse set, Galifianakis did not dial back his trademark style of appearing uninterested and unprepared as he interviewed Clinton, riffing on her previous role as U.S. secretary of state in Obama’s first term.  “As secretary, how many words per minute could you type? And how does President Obama like his coffee? Like himself - weak?” Galifianakis said. “You know Zach, those are really out-of-date questions. You need to get out more,” Clinton responded. Other topics brought up included the comedian’s interest in the designer of Clinton’s signature pantsuits and whether her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, discussed romantic crushes with Ivanka Trump, daughter of Clinton’s Republican opponent, Donald Trump, in the Nov. 8 election. In closing, Galifianakis made a wry reference to Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure as America’s top diplomat, which was investigated by the FBI. “This has been a lot of fun, Mrs. Clinton. We should stay in touch. What’s the best way to reach you? E-mail?” As a poker-faced Clinton looked on, Galifianakis hit a button to play AOL’s famous email alert: “You’ve got mail.” ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Every day, the NFL gives fans another reason to stop supporting them. Although the NFL agreed to refund a small portion of the money our Defense Department (US taxpayers) have paid them to show support for our military, it s the idea that Americans have been duped into believing it was something they did out of honor or reverence for our military. The NFL has reached a new low with their acceptance of players who are disrespecting our flag to promote Obama s race war while disallowing the Dallas Cowboys to honor the 5 police officers slain in their hometown by a Black Lives Matter terrorist. Don t forget, they also looked away when Cleveland Brown s player, Isaiah Crowell posted an Instagram picture of a cop with his neck being slit open. The NFL never said a word. They never even acknowledged what some considered to be a terrorist type threat to our law enforcement.In May 2016, the NFL announced that they would return more than $700,000 of taxpayers  money that was paid to teams for sponsored military tributes.After being criticized for  paid patriotism,  in which money came out of the armed forces budget for various measures of public recognition during games, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said that the league would pay that money back.In a letter written to Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain on Wednesday, and disclosed on Thursday, Goodell said that   following an audited review of 100 marketing agreements from 2012 to 2015 by accounting firm Deloitte & Touche   teams were deemed to have received $723,734 for acts of sponsored patriotism. Given the immense sacrifices made by our service members, it seems more appropriate that any organization with a genuine interest in honoring them, and deriving public credit as a result, should do so at its own expense and not at that of the American taxpayer,  the report said.  Americans deserve the ability to assume that tributes for our men and women in military uniform are genuine displays of national pride, which many are, rather than taxpayer-funded DOD marketing gimmicks.   PGLast year, Flake and McCain disclosed that the U.S. Department of Defense had spent $5.4 million in contracts with 14 NFL teams from 2011 to 2014. Some of those contracts disclosed that payment was for on-field flag ceremonies and tributes to welcome home veterans. One team, the Atlanta Falcons, had made more than $1 million from the department over those four seasons.The National Guard spent $6.7 million on contracts with NFL teams from 2013 to 2015.

We are taught to embrace humility and diversity. We can understand why, in seeking America s highest office, you have used your degree from Wharton to promote and lend legitimacy to your candidacy.As a candidate for President, and now as the presumptive GOP nominee, you have been afforded a transformative opportunity to be a leader on national and international stages and to make the Wharton community even prouder of our school and values.However, we have been deeply disappointed in your candidacy.We, proud students, alumni, and faculty of Wharton, are outraged that an affiliation with our school is being used to legitimize prejudice and intolerance. Although we do not aim to make any political endorsements with this letter, we do express our unequivocal stance against the xenophobia, sexism, racism, and other forms of bigotry that you have actively and implicitly endorsed in your campaign. The Wharton community is a diverse community. We are immigrants and children of immigrants, people of color, Muslims, Jews, women, people living with or caring for those with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQ community. In other words, we represent the groups that you have repeatedly denigrated, as well as their steadfast friends, family, and allies.We recognize that we are fortunate to be educated at Wharton, and we are committed to using our opportunity to make America and the world a better place for everyone. We are dedicated to promoting inclusion not only because diversity and tolerance have been repeatedly proven to be valuable assets to any organization s performance, but also because we believe in mutual respect and human dignity as deeply held values. Your insistence on exclusion and scapegoating would be bad for business and bad for the American economy. An intolerant America is a less productive, less innovative, and less competitive America.We, the undersigned Wharton students, alumni, and faculty, unequivocally reject the use of your education at Wharton as a platform for promoting prejudice and intolerance. Your discriminatory statements are incompatible with the values that we are taught and we teach at Wharton, and we express our unwavering commitment to an open and inclusive American society.In addition, the authors of the letter spoke to NBC about their decision to write it. It was important for us to speak out against Trump because, as we have seen in many moments throughout history, silence is an act of complicity. This open letter speaks on behalf of Wharton students, alumni and faculty who wish to speak out against hate and stand in solidarity with all members of our diverse community   both at Wharton and across America. In short, Donald Trump just received a giant middle finger from the school and it s a safe bet that past faculty regret that he was ever allowed to step foot in their classrooms. Because every time Trump opens his mouth he makes it hard to believe that he could have ever actually earned a degree anywhere in the first place.Featured Image: Mark Lyons/Getty Images",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"FOR decades, automakers have been able to count on a fundamental fact of American life: You pretty much need a car to get around. But lately, novel technologies, including   services like Uber and advances in   cars, are creating new alternatives for commuting, shuttling children and going to the store  —   particularly in urban settings. There are also demographic and economic trends in play. Many younger Americans do not consider owning a car a goal or necessity  —   or a necessary expense. So carmakers are looking ahead to a day when the automobile plays a smaller role, or even no role at all, in many people’s daily routines. “The historical model is you buy a car and it’s in your garage most of the time,” said Glen DeVos, vice president for engineering and services at Delphi Automotive, a big developer and supplier of automobile technology. “It’s the   expensive thing you buy after your home, so if you can get around without owning a car, there are a lot of economic reasons people may not own a car, or own only one instead of two. ” One clear sign of the shift is the increasing energy that carmakers are devoting to a design category the auto industry refers to as the “the first   mile” challenge. It refers to the short distances some people must travel from home or work to a local destination, often a mass transit station. Not so long ago, this challenge was strictly a matter for transportation authorities, and barely registered with automakers. “People really didn’t think of the first   mile issue because the car was the primary way to get around,’’ said Erica Klampfl, the global future mobility manager at Ford Motor Company. “You just drove your car to your destination. ’’ In many ways, the industry’s race to solve the   challenge involves the development of   vehicles, an effort involving various carmakers, technology companies and   firms. General Motors and its partner, Lyft, an Uber rival, are about to begin testing a fleet of   cars ferrying passengers short distances in Detroit and other cities. Uber already has similar trials underway in Pittsburgh and has just expanded its tests to San Francisco. Next year, Delphi Automotive expects to have   Audis providing rides to mass transit stations in a section of Singapore. Ford, meanwhile, has vowed to begin producing a   car, with no steering wheel and no pedals, by 2021. The vehicle would be intended for   services in large cities. If these types of cars and services proliferate, Mr. DeVos at Delphi said, people will have more freedom to not own automobiles. Monica Manjarres, a    college student, is embracing that freedom. She lives in Azusa, Calif. 24 miles east of Los Angeles. In the last year, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority has opened miles of new light rail extensions to its subway system, including a light rail link to Azusa. “If I want to visit my sister in Pasadena, I can walk to the train and it’s a   to   ride,” Ms. Manjarres said. “If you drive, the traffic is usually horrible. ” After she graduates this semester from Azusa Pacific University with a degree in exercise science, Ms. Manjarres says, she hopes to find a job she can reach by train. “I can confidently say I don’t really need a car,” she said. Kelly Skow has all but come to the same conclusion. A    video producer, Ms. Skow lives in Hollywood and commutes on the Los Angeles subway using the new Expo rail extension that goes to Santa Monica, where her office is. She usually covers the first and last mile of the trip on foot. “I only drive maybe once a week, usually to go shopping on weekends,” she said. During the week, her boyfriend uses her car to get to his job. “I had barely ridden the subway before the Expo Line opened, but now I’m using it a lot more and it’s great. Parking in L. A. is a nightmare and you don’t have to deal with that. ” The twist in Ms. Skow’s story: She works for TrueCar, a website that provides automotive pricing and information to help connect consumers with   and   dealers. Forecasters expect people in metropolitan areas to own fewer cars in the future. But they are not ready to predict a big drop in the total number of vehicles sold, which this year will total more than 17 million cars and light trucks in the United States and about 75 million globally. That is, in part, because so many people have more than a last mile to cover. Automakers are generally betting that sales of vehicles to fleet services will offset any decline in sales to individual consumers. Boston Consulting Group predicts that 44, 000 cars will be sold to   fleets in North America in 2021, more than making up for an expected net decline in consumer sales of about 8, 000 vehicles. The bigger impact might be on how the automotive industry  —   not just carmakers, but also fleet service operators, parts makers and the like  —   makes its money in years to come. According to the consulting firm PwC, the global automotive industry generates about $400 billion a year in profits about 41 percent of that  —   or about $164 billion  —   comes from new vehicle sales. By 2030, PwC forecasts that even as overall automotive profits grow to about $600 billion, only about 29 percent of that will come from new vehicle sales. By then, PwC predicts that “mobility services’’  —   including   and other types of   transportation services  —   will represent 20 percent of the automotive industry’s profits. Ford is among the automakers angling to be in position if that shift occurs. “We are on the cusp of a revolution,” Mark Fields, Ford’s chief executive, said at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November. Cars, he said, “are no longer our entire game. ” The company sees mobility services as potentially more profitable than its traditional business of making and selling cars. Manufacturing vehicles requires billions of dollars in investments in plants and engineering  —   costs that are often difficult to recoup. Mobility services would require less upfront investment, Robert Shanks, Ford’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. “Margins could be more like 20 percent instead of the 8 percent we are trying to get to today,” he said. Some of Ford’s mobility efforts don’t involve cars at all. Ford is sponsoring a   program in the San Francisco area, with the goal of having 7, 000 blue,   bikes in operation by 2018. In recent months, the company has also begun demonstrating a motorized conveyance device, created by its engineers, to help people cover the last mile  —   especially if they are carrying luggage or groceries that would make walking a challenge. Called the   it looks like a giant white hockey puck. The passenger stands on it as it travels to her destination, or she can set a parcel on it and have the   follow along. Ford has no plans to put it into production, but the company says it represents the unconventional ways it is thinking about the transportation future. Glimpses of a less   future, and the emergence of new   options, are evident in Southern California, where the new rail system has given many more people easy access to mass transit. Ms. Skow and other residents of Santa Monica, population 92, 000, can now hop on the Expo Line and ride all the way from the coast to downtown Los Angeles, 16 miles to the east. Although Ms. Skow walks to the train, the Santa Monica municipal government has tried to make it easier to reach any of the city’s three Expo Line stops without using a car. Its bus network was completely reorganized to deliver passengers to the stations in time to catch trains. For   service, after buses stop running, riders can get discounted cab rides. The last mile is more of a challenge in Azusa, a city of about 48, 000 that is less compact and walkable than Santa Monica and does not have as big a bus network. Ms. Manjarres, the college student, lives only a short walk from a station. But so many commuters still drive their cars to the train that the city doesn’t have enough parking for them. Theirs is more than a   gap to bridge. “People coming to the train will park in residential neighborhoods or retail parking lots,” said Troy Butzlaff, Azusa’s city manager. That is why the city is building an     solution: a   parking garage.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Donald J. Trump belittled the parents of a slain Muslim soldier who had strongly denounced Mr. Trump during the Democratic National Convention, saying that the soldier’s father had delivered the entire speech because his mother was not “allowed” to speak. Mr. Trump’s comments, in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News that will air on Sunday, drew quick and widespread condemnation and amplified calls for Republican leaders to distance themselves from their presidential nominee. With his implication that the soldier’s mother had not spoken because of female subservience expected in some traditional strains of Islam, his comments also inflamed his hostilities with American Muslims. Khizr Khan, the soldier’s father, lashed out at Mr. Trump in an interview on Saturday, saying his wife had not spoken at the convention because it was too painful for her to talk about her son’s death. Mr. Trump, he said, “is devoid of feeling the pain of a mother who has sacrificed her son. ” Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a rival of Mr. Trump’s in the Republican primaries who has refused to endorse him, castigated him on Twitter. “There’s only one way to talk about Gold Star parents: with honor and respect,” he wrote, using the term for surviving family members of those who died in war. And Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, said he “was not a normal presidential candidate. ” “Someone who attacks everybody has something missing,” she told a crowd at a campaign stop in Youngstown, Ohio. “I don’t know what it is. I’m not going to get into that. ” Mr. Khan’s speech at the convention in Philadelphia was one of the most powerful given there. It was effectively the Democratic response to comments Mr. Trump has made implying many American Muslims have terrorist sympathies or stay silent when they know ones who do. Mr. Trump has called to ban Muslim immigration as a way to combat terrorism. At the convention, Mr. Khan spoke about how his    son, Humayun Khan, an Army captain, died in a car bombing in 2004 in Iraq as he tried to save other troops. He criticized Mr. Trump, saying he “consistently smears the character of Muslims,” and pointedly challenged what sacrifices Mr. Trump had made. Holding a   copy of the Constitution, he asked if Mr. Trump had read it. Mr. Khan’s wife stood silently by his side. Mr. Trump told Mr. Stephanopoulos that Mr. Khan seemed like a “nice guy” and that he wished him “the best of luck. ” But, he added, “If you look at his wife, she was standing there, she had nothing to say, she probably  —   maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say, you tell me. ” Mr. Trump also told Maureen Dowd of The New York Times on Friday night, “I’d like to hear his wife say something. ” In a statement late Saturday, Mr. Trump called Captain Khan a “hero,” and reiterated his belief that the United States should bar Muslims from entering the country. “While I feel deeply for the loss of his son,” he added, “Mr. Khan, who has never met me, has no right to stand in front of millions of people and claim I have never read the Constitution, (which is false) and say many other inaccurate things. ” Even given Mr. Trump’s reputation for retaliating when attacked, his remarks about the Khans were startling. They called to mind one of his earliest counterpunches of the campaign, when he responded to criticism from Senator John McCain of Arizona, once a prisoner of war in Vietnam, by saying at a forum in Iowa, “I like people that weren’t captured. ” But Mr. McCain has a long history in the public eye. The Khans, before their convention appearance, had none. “Trump is totally void of any decency because he is unaware of how to talk to a Gold Star family and how to speak to a Gold Star mother,” Mr. Khan said on Saturday. Ms. Khan did speak on Friday to MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell, saying she “cannot even come in the room where his pictures are. ” When she saw her son’s photograph on the screen behind her on the stage in Philadelphia, she said, “I couldn’t take it. ” “I controlled myself at that time,” she said, while choking back tears. “It is very hard. ” In his interview with The Times, Mr. Khan said his wife had helped him craft his convention speech, and told him to remove certain attacks he had wanted to make against Mr. Trump. But on Saturday, he unmuzzled himself. “Unlike Donald Trump’s wife, I didn’t plagiarize my speech,” Mr. Khan said, referring to how several lines from a Michelle Obama speech found their way into Melania Trump’s address at the Republican National Convention. “I also wanted to talk about how he’s had three wives, and yet he talks about others’ ethics and their religion,” Mr. Khan said. “She said, ‘Don’t go to his level. We are paying tribute to our son. ’” Mr. Trump’s comments provoked another avalanche of criticism on social media, and again put Republican leaders in a difficult position, facing new demands that they repudiate their presidential nominee. Even before Mr. Trump’s remarks to ABC News, Mr. Khan had asked that Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, denounce Mr. Trump. On Saturday, neither directly addressed Mr. Trump’s new comments. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, referred to Mr. McConnell’s response last year that a ban on Muslims entering the United States would be unacceptable. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan, delivered a similar response: “The speaker has made clear many times that he rejects this idea, and himself has talked about how Muslim Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice for this country. ” In the same ABC News interview, when Mr. Stephanopoulos said that Mr. Khan had pointed out that his family would not have been allowed into the United States under Mr. Trump’s proposed ban, the candidate replied, “He doesn’t know that. ” And when asked what he would say to the grieving father, Mr. Trump replied, “I’d say, ‘We’ve had a lot of problems with radical Islamic terrorism. ’” Mr. Stephanopoulos also noted that Mr. Khan said that Mr. Trump had “sacrificed nothing,” and had lost no one. “I think I’ve made a lot of sacrifices,” Mr. Trump replied. “I’ve worked very, very hard. I’ve created thousands and thousands of jobs. ” Some of the fiercest condemnations on Saturday came from Republicans who have argued  —   unsuccessfully to date  —   that Mr. Trump is unfit to be president. Tim Miller, a former communications director for Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, called Mr. Trump’s comments “inhuman. ” “Memo to Trump supporters,” Peter Wehner, a speechwriter for President George W. Bush, wrote on Twitter. “He’s a man of sadistic cruelty. With him there’s no bottom. Now go ahead  defend him. ” Reihan Salam, a conservative writer for National Review and a frequent Trump critic, said that Mr. Trump had an opportunity to declare remorse for the Khans while still holding to his own views as a candidate. “He might have asked why Humayun Khan had died in the first place  —   because of a war that many, if not most, Americans regard as a tragic blunder,” he said. “There was really no benefit for Trump in suggesting that Ghazala Khan had been muzzled,” he added, “because she could easily come out and say that she had been too   to speak, which she did. ” Ibrahim Hooper, the spokesman for the Council on   Relations, said on Saturday, “It’s really despicable that anyone, let alone a presidential candidate, would choose to dishonor the service of an American who gave his life for this nation. ” Ms. Khan, he said, “was obviously there to support her husband, who was offering what many people believe was the most impactful speech of the entire convention. ” As is often the case, Mr. Trump, who has had no campaign events this weekend, managed with a few words to overshadow Mrs. Clinton, who was making several stops in Ohio and Pennsylvania with her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. In the ABC News interview, Mr. Trump also hedged over whether he would participate in the three scheduled debates with Mrs. Clinton. He insinuated that she had worked to schedule two during football games so viewership would be lower, and said that the National Football League had sent him a letter complaining about the timing. The debates were scheduled in September of last year by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. And while Joe Lockhart, a spokesman for the National Football League, said the league was not thrilled about the scheduling, “we did not send a letter to Trump. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Donald Trump has disgraced the United States and made the country s White House an absolute circus   but he s not done ruining things yet. Apparently, the election of Trump is also going to ruin Disney World.According to a report by Motherboard, the Imagineers at Disney World are having a meltdown over having to add this illegitimate president to the Hall of Presidents. Every single POTUS has been added to this feature in Disney World, and now they re faced with a truly awful 45th president that does not deserve to stand beside the others, but must be included to follow tradition.Since 1993, several of the animatronic presidents have had speaking parts in the hall s presentation, which includes a history lesson and music. This presents a unique problem for the people tasked with making the Trump robot   what should a POTUS with the vocabulary and speech patterns of a 5-year-old say? Surely, anything that comes out of Trump s mouth is going to stick out like a sore thumb compared to his wiser, more competent predecessors.The people at Disney have been torn up about this, but Motherboard reports that they ve decided to add him, under the conditions that he doesn t say a damn word. Motherboard wrote: Motherboard spoke via email and phone to a source close to Walt Disney Imagineering the research and development department behind Disney s theme park attractions. And according to the source, Donald Trump will be in the attraction, but he will probably not have a speaking role, unlike the three presidents immediately before him. The Imagineers will likely revert the attraction to its pre-1993 format, where the current president does not speak, while keeping the more realistic, grounded tone of the current show. Apparently, Disney World is also acknowledging the fact that Trump might not be in the White House much longer. Motherboard stated: Given President Trump s current problems, Walt Disney World might elect to push the attraction s opening date back to the fall and then make further tweaks to the show.

0,WELFake Dataset,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Obama commuted most of the prison sentence of Chelsea Manning, the army intelligence analyst sentenced to 35 years in prison for giving a massive trove of secret documents to WikiLeaks. Ms. Manning, already jailed for nearly seven years, will be freed in May. That rescues Ms. Manning, who has tried to commit suicide twice in prison, from an uncertain future as a transgender woman in a male prison. A White House spokesman stressed the differences between Ms. Manning’s clemency application and the pardon application of Edward Snowden, the security contractor who disclosed archives of top secret surveillance files and is living in exile in Russia. _____ 2.   Donald J. Trump’s nominee for secretary of health and human services, Tom Price, is on Capitol Hill this week for his Senate confirmation hearing. He’ll face hard questions over his trades of medical stocks. If confirmed, he’ll lead the effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act. A new report from the Congressional Budget Office said the repeal would cost 18 million people their insurance in the first year. _____ 3. Nigerian fighter jets hunting for Boko Haram militants mistakenly bombed a refugee camp. The medical organization Doctors Without Borders said at least 52 people were killed and 200 injured. “This   attack on vulnerable people who have already fled from extreme violence is shocking and unacceptable,” said an official with the group. _____ 4. A sense of uncertainty is taking hold around the globe as the U. S. prepares for the inauguration of Mr. Trump on Friday. The predictably unpredictable   upset the leaders of China and various European nations with provocative comments in newly published interviews. The inauguration and related events could cost more than $200 million  —   possibly more than half of it for security. In Washington, which Mr. Trump calls “the swamp” and where 91 percent of voters went for Hillary Clinton, “  panic” is setting in. _____ 5. Britain’s leader backed a clean break from the European Union, its single market and its court system. In a   speech on “Brexit,” Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted a “new and equal partnership” with European nations that would allow Britain to regain control of immigration. _____ 6. The Turkish authorities say the Uzbek man accused of killing 39 people at an Istanbul nightclub on New Year’s Day, above, confessed after being captured. The Islamic State had claimed responsibility for the attack. And the widow of Omar Mateen, who pledged allegiance to Islamic State as he killed 49 people at an Orlando nightclub last year, appeared in court. She is charged with aiding and abetting in the attack, and obstructing the investigation. _____ 7. Almost three years after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people on board, officials called off the search in the southern Indian Ocean, the largest and costliest search in aviation history. Relatives of those lost were distraught. “I can’t imagine living the rest of my life accepting that people just disappeared into thin air,” said a woman whose mother was on board. Above, debris was recovered on an island near Madagascar in 2015. _____ 8. We visited the Office of Presidential Correspondence, where a small army of employees and interns read the letters sent by millions of Americans to President Obama. There are tales of woe, joy, pleas for pardons or help with medical bills, a teenager’s report card  —   all sorts of writings. The team sifts through them, and hands Mr. Obama 10 to read each night. And in the last installment of our   series on Mr. Obama’s legacy, we took a look at how the presidency changed him. _____ 9. A small triangular pendant found during the excavation of a Nazi death camp has intrigued Anne Frank experts. It’s engraved with the words “good luck” in Hebrew. Researchers determined that it likely belonged to a    girl: Karoline Cohn, born in Frankfurt in 1929. It was almost identical to one owned by Anne, who was born there the same year. Now they’re trying to determine if the girls could have been friends, or even relatives. _____ 10. Finally, Americans tend to take less time off than their counterparts in industrialized countries. One survey found the average respondent took 12 vacation days when they had 15. (In Spain, they were 30 for 30.) “Guilt and worry” were common rationales.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday urged the Republican-controlled Congress to complete the job of dismantling Obamacare this summer and move on quickly to another big-ticket item on President Donald Trump’s agenda: tax cuts. Speaking days before lawmakers return to Washington amid doubts about their ability to agree on legislation, Pence sought to add urgency to the debate by warning that consumers face dwindling access to Obamacare health coverage in some states. Trump-backed legislation to dismantle former President Barack Obama’s healthcare overhaul narrowly passed the House of Representatives last month. But Senate Republicans have had difficulty agreeing on their own bill, leading Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to fret about the future of healthcare legislation.  “First and foremost, this summer, this Congress must come together and heed the president’s leadership, and we must repeal and replace Obamacare,” Pence told a political rally in Iowa, one of several states where major insurers have exited government-subsidized insurance markets. “It’s high time we take action,” the vice president added, saying Congress must “relieve Iowa and relieve America.”   Insurers say they cannot plan amid the uncertainty  surrounding healthcare legislation. They also face a worse-than-expected balance of sick and healthy customers that has helped drive insurance premiums higher in Obamacare marketplaces. “Once we repeal and replace Obamacare, we’re going to roll our sleeves up, and working with these great leaders in Congress, we’re going to pass one of the largest tax cuts in American history,” Pence said. A former Indiana congressman, Pence plays a key role in Trump’s relationship with lawmakers as the main White House liaison to Congress. As vice president, he also casts the tie-breaking vote on legislation in the 100-member Senate, where Republicans have a slim 52-seat majority.   Senate Republican staff are expected to present legislative options on healthcare when lawmakers return to Capitol Hill on Monday after a one-week recess, according to aides. But some Republicans are skeptical that healthcare legislation can pass the Senate this summer, if at all. Pence projected confidence that Congress will succeed: “I know we will. The Obamacare nightmare is about to end.”  ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false. I know the correct answer, but I want to check your ability to identify true or false information.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Fox News host Bill O Reilly finally lost a years-long battle with his own children over his right to have custody of them. A New York appeals court put an end to the protracted family battle by affirming a lower court s decision that O Reilly s teenage children don t have to see him if they don t want to and that they can live full-time with their mother, Maureen McPhilmy.This is quite a slap in the face for O Reilly, a man who never hestitated to lecture (mostly African-American) parents on how to raise their families. Even while privately fighting his ex-wife and his own children, the pundit felt brazenly self-assured in telling his viewers that letting their children listen to Beyonce causes teen pregnancy. In 2013, he wrote an op-ed suggesting liberal parents being too gentle with their kids has led to almost all of society s ills. He used Miley Cyrus twerking at the MTV Music Awards as an example.Of course, this being Fox, poor parents were an even more frequent target. Here is a typically shameful exchange O Reilly had with a guest in 2015:O REILLY: OK. Let s take your situation, all right? From what I understand from our research of you, in San Diego, when you were growing up, there was a six month period in 1983-84 where you were hungry; is that correct? As a child.JOHNSON-HUSTON: I was homeless.O REILLY: You were homeless and hungry.JOHNSON-HUSTON: Yes.O REILLY: And that is because your mother   no father, right?JOHNSON-HUSTON: Father wasn t around.O REILLY: OK. Your mother was an alcoholic, is that true?JOHNSON-HUSTON: She had alcohol and drug issues, yes.O REILLY: OK. And drugs issues. Now, my point is: I feel terrible for you that you had to go through that, I really do. And I give literally hundreds of thousands of dollars to charities to help kids who are in your circumstance. You should know that.JOHNSON-HUSTON: Thank you and I appreciate it.O REILLY: But that s not society s fault that your mother was a drug addict and alcoholic and you didn t have a father. That s not my fault. But that was my point and it was clearly made.But while O Reilly loves to take the moral high ground when lecturing his guests and audience, at home there is reason to believe he is an unequivocal monster. The  angry  persona he plays for his Fox News crowd apparently doesn t go away when the cameras stop rolling. During the legal battle, all of O Reilly s skeletons came out of his closet and the picture was disturbing. In one example, leaked to the press, O Reilly s young daughter told a forensic examiner that she had watched O Reilly brutally assault her mom in a fit of rage.According to a source familiar with the facts of the case, a court-appointed forensic examiner testified at a closed hearing that O Reilly s daughter claimed to have witnessed her father dragging McPhilmy down a staircase by her neck, apparently unaware that the daughter was watching.Later, O Reilly attempted to destroy his ex-wife s reputation, going so far as to attempt to use his clout as a Republican celebrity to get her excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church.The New York appeals court seems to have taken this pattern of abuse into account when they issued their ruling:Viewing the totality of the circumstances, there is a sound and substantial basis for the Supreme Court s determination that it is in the best interests of the children for the mother to be awarded primary residential custody. Particularly relevant in this case are the clearly stated preferences of the children, especially considering their age and maturity, and the quality of the home environment provided by the mother.O Reilly denies any and all of the allegations levied against him, but even if only some of them were true, it s probably a very good thing that his children are allowed to stay away from his influence.Featured image via Fox News",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A little-known Chinese elevator maker saw its Shenzhen-listed shares surge the maximum 10 percent on Wednesday. The reason? The company s name resembles that of Wang Huning, a Chinese Communist Party theoretician who was elevated on Wednesday to China s apex of power.  The frenzied buying in Hangzhou Huning Elevator Parts Co, whose business has nothing to do with Wang, offers the latest example of the enduring influence of short-term speculators, despite regulators  stepped-up campaign against  pump and dump  trading. The government is introducing more foreign institutional investors, hoping they can help improve the trading culture in the country s stock market - sometimes likened to a casino. U.S. index publisher MSCI will include China A-shares in its global indexes next year. But Wednesday s surge in Huning Elevator shows that many investors still pick stocks merely by name, not fundamentals.  This is pure speculation, spurred by irrational euphoria. It has nothing to do with fundamentals,  said Yang Hai, analyst at Kaiyuan Securities.  Heady investors who chased the stock will be burnt.       Trading in Huning Elevator was calm in the morning, but that changed after the Communist Party revealed around midday its new Politburo Standing Committee, the country s top policy-making body. The seven-man unit included Wang, a one-time law professor from Shanghai who has risen steadily up the party s ranks but mostly operated behind the scenes. When the stock resumed trading in the afternoon, a buying spree pushed it up the maximum 10 percent. It gave up some gains in afternoon trading and closed up 6 percent. The elevator maker, which cannot be immediately reached for comment, forecast roughly flat nine-month profit on Oct. 13. Name-based stock-picking is not uncommon in China, especially during major political events. Last November, when news headlines pointed to a likely presidential election win for Donald Trump, shares in Wisesoft Co Ltd - whose Chinese name sounds like  Trump s big win  - surged, while Yunan Xiyi Industrial- whose Chinese name bears resemblance to  Aunt Hillary  - slumped. And when Barack Obama won the U.S. presidential election in 2008, speculators piled into home appliances maker Aucma Co Ltd, which sounds roughly like the Chinese pronunciation of Obama. Some listed firms in China even took advantage of speculators  preference for sexy names. In 2015, property developer Shanghai Duolun Industry changed its name to P2P Financial Information Services Co, in an apparent attempt to tap into investors  mania toward fin tech at the time, triggering a surge in its shares, before the bubble burst.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Donald Trump betrayed Americans on Tuesday by proving to be exactly as large an environmental threat as was predicted. Trump gloated on Twitter that he was signing authorizations to move forward both with the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. Signing orders to move forward with the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines in the Oval Office,  Trump tweeted Tuesday afternoon. The Washington Post reports:Dealing a blow to former President Barack Obama s legacy on climate change, President Donald Trump signed executive actions Tuesday to advance the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, a move cheered by congressional Republicans and decried by environmentalists.Trump told reporters at the White House that the actions on the pipelines will be subject to the terms and conditions being negotiated by U.S. officials.Not everyone is happy about Trump s new order.  Americans know this pipeline was unfairly rerouted towards our nation and without our consent. The existing pipeline route risks infringing on our treaty rights, contaminating our water and the water of 17 million Americans downstream,  said Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock tribe with whom thousands upon thousands of protesters have joined in opposition to a plan to route the Dakota pipeline under a lake near the tribe s reservation. Such a move, anyone with critical thinking skills realizes, would threaten the area s water supply and sacred Native American sites.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers agreed late last year to begin an environmental assessment and consider alternative routes, but it is unclear what will happen now that Trump has given his go-ahead. It seems the whole of Twitter also disagrees with the move.

International leaders have joined hands to create the world’s largest marine park in the Antarctic Ocean. The European Union and 24 countries have reached a momentous agreement to open the Ross Sea Park. 
The deal was sealed in Hobart, Australia after prolonged negotiations run by the United Nation’s Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. 
The Ross Sea marine park will cover an area of 1.55 million square kilometers and is to be protected from commercial fishing for 35 years. 
The preserved area covers more than 12 percent of the Southern Ocean and is home to more than 10,000 species. Scientists and activists consider the deal a historic milestone after decades of global efforts in marine preservation. 
The Ross Sea is seen as one of the world's most ecologically important oceans for its unique qualities. Scientists believe that the marine park can be a platform for a deeper understanding of climate change impacts.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Just like Hillary Stephanopoulos claims it was an  honest mistake  not to disclose his donations to the corrupt Clinton slush fund ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos has given $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation in recent years, charitable contributions that he did not publicly disclose while reporting on the Clintons or their non-profit organization, the On Media blog has learned.In both 2013 and 2014, Stephanopoulos made a $25,000 donation to the 501 nonprofit founded by former president Bill Clinton, the Foundation s records show. Stephanopoulos never disclosed this information to viewers, even when interviewing author Peter Schweizer last month about his book  Clinton Cash,  which alleges that donations to the Foundation may have influenced some of Hillary Clinton s actions as Secretary of State.In a statement to the On Media blog on Thursday, Stephanopoulos apologized and said that he should have disclosed the donations to ABC News and its viewers.Watch George discuss the problem with donations to the Clinton Foundation on the Daily Show with John Stewart, and how it might make people question if donations to the Foundation could be seen as  pernicious : I made charitable donations to the Foundation in support of the work they re doing on global AIDS prevention and deforestation, causes I care about deeply,  he said.  I thought that my contributions were a matter of public record. However, in hindsight, I should have taken the extra step of personally disclosing my donations to my employer and to the viewers on air during the recent news stories about the Foundation. I apologize. Stephanopoulos is the chief anchor and chief political correspondent for ABC News, as well as the co-anchor of ABC s  Good Morning America  and host of  This Week,  its Sunday morning public affairs program. Prior to joining ABC News, he served as communications director and senior advisor for policy and strategy to President Clinton. He also served as communications director on Bill Clinton s 1992 presidential campaign.In its own statement on Thursday, ABC News said it was standing behind its star anchor. As George has said, he made charitable donations to the Foundation to support a cause he cares about deeply and believed his contributions were a matter of public record,  the network s statement read.  He should have taken the extra step to notify us and our viewers during the recent news reports about the Foundation. He s admitted to an honest mistake and apologized for that omission. We stand behind him. ABC News later told the On Media blog that it would not take any punitive action against Stephanopoulos:  We accept his apology,  a spokesperson said.  It was an honest mistake. Sources with knowledge of Stephanopoulos  charitable giving said he gives to dozens of charities Stephanopoulosevery year and that the total sum of these annual contributions is in the millions of dollars. Those sources said that the Clinton Foundation contributions represent a very small percentage of the total.On the April 26 edition of  This Week,  Stephanopoulos interviewed Schweizer and challenged the author s assertions that Hillary Clinton may have committed a crime because there was a  troubling pattern  between donations to the Foundation and Clinton s actions as Secretary of State. We ve done investigative work here at ABC News, found no proof of any kind of direct action,  the host told Schweizer.  An independent government ethics expert, Bill Allison, of the Sunlight Foundation, wrote this. He said,  There s no smoking gun, no evidence that she changed the policy based on donations to the foundation.  No smoking gun. Later in the interview, Stephanopoulos said,  I still haven t heard any direct evidence and you just said you had no evidence that she intervened here.  He also noted that other news organizations that used Schweizer s research  haven t confirmed any evidence of any crime. Among the more notable revelations to come out of Schweizer s research is the relationship between the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One, a former Canadian mining company that was taken over by Russia in 2013 with U.S. government approval. Between 2009 to 2013, Uranium One s chairman donated $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation.Hillary Clinton has said that there is  not an inherent conflict of interest  between the Foundation donations and her decisions at the State Department.

0,WELFake Dataset,"BELFAST (Reuters) - The British government on Monday extended by 24 hours a deadline for Northern Ireland s political parties to re-establish a devolved regional executive and avoid London setting the region s annual budget for the first time in a decade.  The pro-British Democratic Unionist Party and the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party made progress in talks on Monday and they will continue talking on Tuesday, the British government s minister for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire said.   In the light of this, I believe it is right to defer the assessment on whether to introduce legislation to Parliament this week to enable an executive to be formed,  Brokenshire said in a statement.  The parties will recommence talks in the morning and I will reassess the position tomorrow night,  he said, adding that the British government would consider  certain additional requests  made by the parties.        Brokenshire had earlier indicated that if there was no deal by the end of Monday it would move to pass an annual budget for the region to ensure essential services are funded.  A budget set by the British government would be a major step towards direct rule from London for the first time in a decade, which observers have warned could destabilize a delicate political balance in the region.  The DUP and Sinn Fein have shared power for the past decade in a system created following a 1998 peace deal which ended three decades of violence in the province. But Sinn Fein in January pulled out complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner.  Talks between Sinn Fein and the DUP have stalled in recent weeks, in large part over proposals to improve the rights of Irish language speakers. Ahead of the talks, Sinn Fein regional assembly member Conor Murphy said the government could only be reformed  on the basis of equality, rights and respect , which would require concessions from the DUP.   While the DUP also said it wanted to see the executive re-established, ahead of the talks it called for London to bring forward the budget  to bring a measure of good government to Northern Ireland . Neither party spoke to assembled media on the state of the talks on Monday evening.  The outcome of talks was not expected to have an impact on the DUP s agreement to support British Prime Minister Theresa May s government in the British parliament.

Check out the back and forth with Kate Snow and Robbie Mook:After Clinton was seen falling into a van after attending a 9/11 memorial Sunday morning, the campaign said she was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. The campaign did not mention the illness until her collapse yesterday.Snow also grilled Mook on the timeline between Clinton s fall into the van and her reappearance outside daughter Chelsea s apartment in Manhattan. Mook said Clinton wanted to cool off and see her grandchildren. ROBBIE MOOK   LYING THROUGH HIS TEETH: KATE SNOW, MSNBC: Did you know on Friday, Robby, that she was ill? Did you know that she had the diagnosis of pneumonia and if so, what did you advise her to do?ROBBY MOOK, CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Well, she obviously saw the doctor on Friday and in consultation with her doctors, she decided to power through this. She didn t want it to affect anything. And obviously on Sunday when she got overheated it was clear she needed some downtime. So in consultation with her doctor she s taking some downtime.KATE SNOW: I asked because you are the campaign manager. You are the one in charge of this schedule and what she s doing and I wonder if you didn t know, would you have advised her to take a couple days down and not plan this trip to California today?ROBBY MOOK: Well, I am certainly   let s just say I am happy that she s getting some much needed downtime now. But she s looking forward to getting back out on the trail very soon KATE SNOW: Robby, I m reading between the lines and I want to make sure I am not misreading. I m reading between the lines of what you re saying   the staff did not know that she had pneumonia.ROBBY MOOK: Yeah, but, I want to be fair here.

0,WELFake Dataset,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - More than 300 people were killed by twin bomb explosions in Mogadishu, an official said on Monday, as locals packed hospitals in search of friends and relatives caught by Somalia s deadliest attack in a decade. The death toll has steadily risen since Saturday, when the blasts struck at two busy junctions in the heart of the capital city. One truck bomb detonated near a fuel truck, creating an enormous fireball. The bomb attacks were the deadliest since Islamist militant group al Shabaab began an insurgency in 2007. Al Shabaab has not claimed responsibility, but the method and type of attack - a large truck bomb - is increasingly used by the al Qaeda-linked organization.  We have confirmed 300 people died in the blast. The death toll will still be higher because some people are still missing,  Abdikadir Abdirahman, the director of the city s ambulance service, told Reuters. Aden Nur, a doctor at the city s Madina hospital, said they had recorded 258 deaths and that 160 of the bodies could not be recognized.   (They)were buried by the government yesterday. The others were buried by their relatives. Over a hundred injured were also brought here,  he told Reuters at the hospital. Some of the injured were being evacuated by air to Turkey for treatment, officials said. Locals visiting their injured relatives or collecting their bodies filled every available space in Madina hospital.  My last time to speak with my brother was some minutes before the blast occurred,  Halima Nur, a local mother, told Reuters.  I am afraid he was among the unrecognized charred bodies that were buried yesterday. I have no hope of getting him alive or dead. But I cannot go home.  Abdullahi Aden, 56, said five of his cousins had died.   The shop completely collapsed on them. I could not help them. I could not hear their screams and the nearby buildings were burning,  he said. He was still searching for two other relatives. Al Shabaab stages regular attacks in the capital and other parts of the country. Although the group claims it targets the government and security forces, it has detonated large bombs in crowded public areas before.  It has sometimes not claimed responsibility for bombings that provoked a big public backlash, like the 2009 suicide bombing of a graduation ceremony for medical students.  The group is waging an insurgency against Somalia s U.N.-backed government and its African Union allies in a bid to impose its own strict interpretation of Islam. The militants were driven out of Mogadishu in 2011 and have been steadily losing territory. But Al Shabaab retains the capacity to mount large bomb attacks. Over the past three years, the number of civilians killed by insurgent bombings has steadily climbed as al Shabaab increases the size of its bombs. In 2016, 723 Somalis were killed in 395 bomb attacks, according to Nairobi-based thinktank Sahan Research, up from 193 deaths in 265 attacks in 2015.  Some of those seriously injured in Saturday s bombing were moved by ambulance to the airport on Monday morning to be flown to Turkey for further treatment.  Workers unloaded boxes of medicine and other medical supplies from a Turkish military plane and Turkish medical teams attended to the injured moved from the hospital for evacuation.

0,WELFake Dataset,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico and the United States will be stuck at an impasse unless they solve U.S. President Donald Trump’s “unacceptable” demand of payment for a border wall, Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday. Fresh home from failed talks in Washington, Guajardo also expressed concern about Trump’s “unpredictability” and habits on Twitter. President Enrique Pena Nieto on Thursday canceled a scheduled visit to the United States next week following Trump’s insistence that Mexico “respect” the United States and pay for a new wall on the southern U.S. border.  “Sincerely, there is clear disagreement at the moment because of a campaign promise he made that from the Mexican perspective is unacceptable,” Guajardo told Mexican television network Televisa.  “It is serious, because it leaves us at an impasse until we find a mechanism to resolve it,” the minister said, adding that  Trump should not underestimate Mexico’s resolve on the issue.  “Mexicans are not going to pay.” He said communication with Trump’s team remained open.   The White House on Thursday floated the idea of imposing a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico to pay for a wall at the southern U.S. border, sending the peso tumbling and deepening the crisis between the two neighbors. Guajardo said the United States and Mexico could reach mutually beneficial improvements to the North American Free Trade Agreement if the issue of paying for the wall was resolved.   Trump had tweeted on Thursday that it would be better for the Mexican leader not to come to Washington if Mexico would not pay for the wall. Guajardo joined Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray in meetings with White House senior officials on Wednesday. He said that the meetings had been productive, but that Trump’s later tweet had forced Mexico to cancel due to the question of “dignity.”  “That unpredictability of reaction creates problems,” Guajardo said, referring to Trump’s Thursday tweet even as he praised a constructive attitude of other members of Trump’s team including Trump strategist Stephen Bannon.  “Their attitude to work, to plan, to see solutions is extraordinary, Believe me” Guajardo said.  Trump kept up his criticism of Mexico on Friday saying the United States’ southern neighbor had taken advantage of it long enough and demanding that “Massive trade deficits & little help on the very weak border must change NOW!” ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"FERGUSON, Mo. -- Less than 24 hours after two officers were hit by gunfire, a quieter protest took place outside police headquarters Thursday night, with no problems or arrests in this city torn by racial unrest. Missouri highway patrol and St. Louis County police took over security for the evening.

As the clock approached midnight, organizers dismissed the people who had gathered.

Earlier on Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder sharply condemned the shootings of police Wednesday night as a ""disgusting and cowardly attack.""

""What happened last night was a pure ambush,"" Holder said. ""This was not someone trying to bring healing to Ferguson. This was a damn punk, a punk, who was trying to sow discord.""

President Obama, in an appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel Live TV show Thursday night, said, ""We don't yet know what happened"" in the shooting but offered his prayers to the wounded officers and their families.

""There's no excuse for criminal acts,'' the president said. ""They're criminals. They need to be arrested. And then what we need to do is make sure that like-minded, good-spirited people on both sides, law-enforcement who have a terrifically tough job and people who understand they don't want to be stopped and harassed because of their race, that we're able to work together to try and come up with some good answers.""

Mayor John Knowles was notified that the highway patrol and county would take over the security duties from the Ferguson police department ""until further notice,"" the county police department said in a statement.

Sgt. Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the St. Louis County police, said investigators interviewed several people regarding the shooting but made no arrests.

Just after 8 p.m., clergy gathered blocks from the Ferguson Police Department for a candlelight vigil. They prayed for the safety of the demonstrators and for the health of the two wounded police officers.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon was in St. Louis County to be briefed by local officials. He said the highway patrol and county police will be sending additional officers in anticipation of more protests Thursday night.

""I ask Missourians to join me in calling for calm in the wake of the cowardly and reprehensible ambush of two police officers who were acting to protect the public,"" Nixon said. ""I also thank all the brave law enforcement officers who selflessly risk their lives each day to keep communities safe.""

Routine police service remains in the hands of the embattled Ferguson police department, whose chief resigned in the wake of scathing criticism of the force by the Justice Department for racially biased policing.

St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar had called for a ""measured response"" to the shooting of the two officers around midnight Wednesday, but reserved the right to beef up security as warranted.

The two officers ""took a very hard hit"" and were seriously injured, but will not sustain long-term injuries, he said. They were released from the hospital Thursday morning.

""We were lucky by God's grace that we didn't lose two officers last night,"" Belmar told reporters. ""We could have buried two police officers over this. ... It's a miracle we haven't had any instances similar to this in the summer and fall.""

Police recovered shell casings at the scene and fanned out across the city looking for the shooter.

A St. Louis County SWAT team stormed a home about four blocks from the police station Thursday morning, clambering on top off the roof, KSDK-TV reported.

Neighbors said three people were taken from the home in handcuffs. Police said they were taken in for questioning, but there were no immediate arrests.

The shootings occurred as demonstrators were winding up a protest following the resignation of the city's police chief in the wake of a scathing Justice Department report alleging bias in the police department and court.

""This is really an ambush,"" he said. ""You can't see it coming. You don't understand that it's going to happen and you're basically defenseless from the fact that it is happening to you at the time. ""

Belmar said one of the officers, a 32-year-old, seven-year veteran from nearby Webster Groves, was shot below his right eye. The bullet lodged near his right ear, he said.

The second officer, a 41-year-old with 14 years on the St. Louis County force, was hit in the shoulder by a bullet that came out his back.

At the time of the shooting, Belmar said, the number of demonstrators had dwindled from around 150 to about 75 and the number of police at the scene had dropped to about 40.

He said the two wounded officers were standing in a line of 20 to 25 other officers when three or four shots were fired from about 125 feet away.

""I feel very confident that whoever did this was there for the wrong reason, not the right reason, and came there for whatever nefarious reason it was,"" Belmar said in a news conference. ""But I do feel like there was an unfortunate association with that gathering.""

Jeff Roorda, who heads the St. Louis Police Officers Association, said the shooting sent a chill through the law enforcement community.

He called on state and county officials to restrict protests to daytime hours.

""This is a very volatile situation,"" Roorda said. ""You have outside agitators racing to be here. This isn't safe for police, community or peaceful protesters.""

Roorda said he's spoken to the police officer who was shot in the shoulder and that he was doing remarkably well considering the circumstances.

Police officers at the scene last night said were jolted by the timing of the incident. The protests were breaking up and only a few dozen demonstrators were left when the shots were fired.

""There's been a recurring phenomenon throughout the protests where you see the flash-points, the bad things coming ,"" he said. ""But last night, as it was described to me by many of the cops that were here here, it wasn't that way. The crowd was just mulling around. A lot of the protesters were starting to disperse. No one saw it coming.""

The shootings came hours after Ferguson officials announced that Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who will step down March 19.

Jackson, 57, became the third top city official to leave following the release of the Justice Department report. Judge Ronald Brockmeyer and City Manager John Shaw resigned earlier this week.

Lt. Col. Al Eickhoff is serving as acting chief until the city completes a nationwide search for a new police chief, the city said in a news release. Jackson will receive a severance payment of approximately $100,000 and health insurance for one year.

Belmar said he has called for a ""measured response"" to the shootings, but reserved the right to call upon the highway patrol for additional help if necessary.

He said police are planning to assess their security plans outside the Ferguson Police Department and talk to protesters and community leaders about how to move forward.

When asked about security in the area moving forward, Belmar said it is very difficult to sustain this kind of situation without injuries to the public or police officers.

""I think we need to re-evaluate that, and that's one of the things I've been doing since my phone rang at midnight tonight,"" said Belmar. ""We're going to be looking for different ways to approach this. Obviously my first priority is to the community, but that's followed very very closely to my police officers and making sure that they're able to do what they're supposed to do out there in a safe manner.""

Earlier in the day, Obama condemned the shootings, saying in a tweet that ""violence against police is unacceptable."" ""Our prayers are with the officers in MO,"" he wrote. ""Path to justice is one all of us must travel together.""

St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger said doesn't believe the shooting will set back any gains made in the city.

""I don't consider this incident a setback toward healing,"" he said. ""I don't believe it's going to affect any healing process that is going on in the community. I think the community at large is fully supportive of these police officers and probably wishes the very best for them.""

Knowles and the Ferguson City Council released a statement thanking law enforcement agencies that have helped the city in the past seven months and reaching out the community.

""While we respect the right to peacefully protest, we cannot continue to move forward under threats of violence and destruction to our community,"" the statement said. ""We ask our residents and clergy in this area to partner with us as we make our way through this process.""

The shootings came as a shock to the crowds gathered outside the police department. DeRay McKesson, 29, one of the most visible protesters in Ferguson, was sitting in his car and about to tweet that the crowd was thinning out when he heard about four gunshots to his right.

""It was like pow, pow, pow, pow — like four consistent shots,"" he said. ""I was looking straight up at the police department and I see an officer fall and I see officers surround him.""

McKesson said protesters, who had been gathered at the police department since 8 p.m. Wednesday, hit the ground as soon as the shots rang out and scattered trying to get to safety amid the chaos.

""Every single gun any officer had was drawn and they were all behind something,"" he said, adding that officers ran and ducked behind cars and the department building.

St. Louis County Alderman posted a Vine showing people crawling on the ground after police reacted to the gunshots.

Heather De Mian, 44, of St. Charles, Mo., was live streaming the scene outside of the police department when the shots rang out.

""Those gunshots went right past my head,"" said De Mian, who is in a wheelchair and tried to duck down. ""I tried to go down low so my head wasn't sticking out.""

She said soon after the shots a swarm of St. Louis County Police crime scene cars showed up and later, a group of officers marched up the hill on a side street in the direction of where the sound of gunshots had come from.

Meanwhile, De Mian is adamant that the shooters were not with demonstrators.

""The shots came from a block away from the protests,"" she said. ""It's incredibly dangerous to try to link the protesters to this without evidence. It could be someone trying to frame the protesters or someone who was aiming at the protesters and was a bad shot. Whoever shot put everyone's life in danger.""

An Aug. 9 shooting of unarmed African-American teen Michael Brown by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson set off weeks of unrest and violence in the St. Louis suburb.

Brown's family issued a statement Thursday condemning the police shootings. ""We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement,"" the statement said. They also denounced the actions of ""stand-alone agitators"" who might try to derail the a peaceful movement addressed at police brutalit

0,WELFake Dataset,"On Friday, former President Bill Clinton encountered a rude protester during a campaign event in Bluffton, South Carolina and proved that he was not to be messed with.The protester, who claimed to be a Marine veteran, confronted Bill about his wife s involvement in the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya and was met with deafening  boos  from the 500-person crowd. Still, Bill heard the army vet out, but unfortunately did not get the same respect when he tried to give him an answer. Bill said: You listen to me, as I ve heard you. I m not your commander-in-chief anymore, but if I were, I d tell you to be more polite. Bill tried to be cordial, but as the unconfirmed vet repeatedly demanded to know if Hillary had lied about the four American lives that were lost during the attack, Clinton lost his patience and said: If you shut up and listen to my answer, I ll answer it. His mind has been poisoned by lies, and he won t listen. Even as the marine was being escorted out of the audience by security, he continued to shout at Bill Clinton, which encouraged another audience member to harass Bill in his place. The second protester shouted over the crowd s  boos , She lied to those families. So all of those families are liars? Then the crowd came to Bill s defense, telling the protester  You re watching too many movies  as she was also escorted out of the event. Throughout the entire incident, the former president maintained his composure and remained calm while these two idiots tried to call his wife out and pathetically fail.After the protesters were gone, Bill defended Hillary and revealed that she lost many  personal friends  in the attack. He said, You can imagine how she feels when people make these charges. It s amazing that right-wingers just can t let Benghazi go. There was nothing to be lied about or covered up, but so many conservatives will do anything to keep smearing Hillary s name because she s such a big threat to them.You can watch the event footage below: Featured image via screenshots",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Not too long after taking office, Trump decided to start asking around about how the government could roll back regulations and make it easier for companies to get their projects approved. But he didn t ask ordinary Americans, or small business owners. He didn t ask people in small towns and big cities. He asked big corporations what their opinions were. He sought advice from the same people he blasted as  The Swamp  during his campaign, and promised repeatedly to drain it.Now, given who he s appointed to his cabinet, it was pretty clear that he had zero intention of draining the swamp. Trump specifically targeted manufacturers and fossil fuel producers for this, probably because he thinks allowing them to run roughshod will at least help him pretend he s truly bringing manufacturing jobs back. But this is even more egregious because major industry insiders don t care about people. They don t care who they hurt in pursuit of the almighty dollar. Of course they want industry regulations cut   these are the industries people fought (and died) against to stop things like child labor and worker exploitation.The White House got 168 comments total. Manufacturers went after the EPA the hardest, with 79 of those comments targeting that agency. The EPA received 79 comments total, because of course it did. And companies targeted the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts with 48 and 29 comments respectively, because having to clean up after yourself so everyone around you can breathe clean air and drink clean water is just too difficult.Trump s decision to halt key provisions of the Clean Water Act has already angered people, particularly those living in communities that are especially vulnerable to poisoned water. The director of the Sierra Club s  Beyond Coal  campaign has said: Trump s attempt to halt these clean water protections for mercury, lead, and arsenic from coal power plants is dangerous and irresponsible. After years of peer-reviewed studies, extensive input from medical experts and scientists, and thorough review of public comments, the EPA made the right call in finalizing strong clean water protections against coal plants dumping toxic heavy metals into our waterways As a mother, I m frankly horrified that the EPA would put the safety of drinking water at risk for millions of Americans, but that s exactly what they ve done. Coming from West Virginia, where we ve had enormous challenges with maintaining clean water supplies due to the coal industry s political influence, I m outraged that these common sense protections are under attack from the EPA itself. But, well, profit is king here, even though the coal industry is never going to recover no matter what Trump tries to do. A full breakdown of the agencies and regulations that these companies would like to see rolled back, if not outright eliminated, is below:BP says it wants to make it easier to drill for gas and oil in the very same Gulf that was devastated in the Deepwater Horizon disaster, because why force them be careful when they can lie about being able to self-regulate? (Big corporations can t self-regulate.) And The Associated General Contractors of America wants to roll back regulations for paid sick leave for government contractors. They probably want to get rid of overtime rules, too.Of course, business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are applauding Trump for this. They see this administration as one that is finally interested in relieving businesses  from a regulatory onslaught that occurred, principally, during the prior administration. Others are not so sure this is the best way to do things, though, because companies will always, always, always act in their own best interests, and damn the rest of the world. Jeffrey Zients, who worked on regulatory issues under Obama, said: At a time when many CEOS are focused on the short term and looking to maximize their profitability each quarter, I believe that a lot of their aversion to these regulations reflects a short-term mind-set that values reducing costs over anything else.That s unfortunate, because well-crafted regulations are an important part of creating sustainable and fair economic prosperity in the long run. A detail. These companies don t want sustainable and fair economic prosperity in the long run. They want unfair and profitable in the short run. It s the nature of the beast. And it s why the business world needs strong regulation. Instead, Trump is trying to give them back the ability to do what they want, when they want, how they want, without regard to the harm they cause.Featured image by Ron Sachs   Pool via Getty Images",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter There are articles floating around the internet suggesting that the Russian government has claimed that America never landed on the moon. This is absolutely ridiculous. Neither the Russian government nor any of its representatives have alluded to this. They are, however, calling for an international investigation regarding “murky details” that surround the U.S. moon landings between 1969 and 1972. ( source )   Why a mainstream news outlet like the Washington Post would title an article “Russian official wants to investigate whether U.S. moon landings actually happened ” is curious, to say the least ( source ) Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for Russia’s official government Investigative Committee, has argued that such an investigation could bring to light what’s been kept in the dark for a number of years with regards to these trips into outer space. Markin and the Russian government are referring to the disappearance of film footage from the original moon landing in 1969. They are also referring to the (approximately) 400 kilograms of lunar rock that was obtained during multiple missions between 1969 and 1972. “We are not contending that they did not fly (to the moon), and simply made a film about it. But all of these scientific – or perhaps cultural – artefacts are part of the legacy of humanity, and their disappearance without a trace is our common loss. An investigation will reveal what happened.”– Vladimir Markin ( source ) From the U.S. side, NASA did admit that the original recordings of the first moon landing had been completely erased. Despite this, they also said that they had managed to remaster the original television broadcast of the landing.   According to Bob Dean, United States Army Command Sargent Major, who also served at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) of NATO as an intelligence analyst, there is more footage that has been erased and hidden than we’ve not been told about: “Ladies and gentlemen, my government, NASA, which many of us in the United States say stands for Never A Straight Answer, proceeded to erase 40 rolls of film of the Apollo Program — the flight to the Moon, the flight around the Moon, the landings on the Moon, the walking guys here and there. They erased, for Christ’s sake, 40 rolls of film of those events. Now we’re talking about several thousand individual frames that were taken that the so-called authorities determined that you did not have a right to see. Oh, they were ‘disruptive,’‘socially unacceptable,’‘politically unacceptable.’ I’ve become furious. I’m a retired Command Sergeant Major. I was never famous for having a lot of patience.” (source) What Really Happened Out There? 
For anybody who has done any research regarding our trips to the moon, there is definitely no lack of mystery. A lot of this has been sparked by NASA astronauts themselves who have made some remarkable claims. There are so many statements from so many astronauts it’s really hard to pick the best ones. 
You may instantly place this topic in the conspiracy realm, but with all of the evidence that’s emerged within the past few years alone, nobody can rely have any sound rebuttal against it. Remember, a wise man once said that “condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.” 
“I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet and the UFO phenomenon is real, although it’s been covered up by governments for quite a long time. Yes there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered. We are not alone, they have been coming here for a long time.” – Dr. Edgar Mitchell, Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 14, 6th man to walk on the moon. ( source )( source )( source )( source ) “There is abundant evidence that we are being contacted, that civilizations have been monitoring us for a very long time. That their appearance is bizarre from any type of traditional materialistic western point of view. That these visitors use the technologies of consciousness, they use toroids, they use co-rotating magnetic disks for their propulsion systems, that seems to be a common denominator of the UFO phenomenon.” ( source ) – Dr. Brian O’Leary, Former NASA Astronaut and Princeton Physics Professor “In my opinion I think they were worried that it would panic the public if they knew that someone had vehicles that had this kind of performance … so they started telling lies about it. And then I think they had to cover another lie, you know, tell another lie to cover their first lie, now they don’t know how to get out of it. Now it’s going to be so embarrassing to admit that all these administrations have told a lot of untruths…. [and that] there are a number of extraterrestrial vehicles out there cruising around.” ( source ) – Gordon Cooper, Former NASA Astronaut, Aeronautical Engineer, and test pilot; one of the seven original astronauts in Project Mercury, the first manned space program of the United States 
“At no time when the astronauts were in space were they alone. They were under constant surveillance by UFOs.”– Maurice Chatelain, who worked at NASA. He holds 12 patents. His expertise was to invent radio equipment used to go to the moon. Here is an example of one of his patents. ( source ) 
There are many more examples to choose from, and the quotes coming from NASA personnel and the people who have been in outer space could fill pages. Think about that for a moment.

0,WELFake Dataset,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Senator Nick Xenophon, a key independent lawmaker,  said on Friday he was resigning from national politics, potentially complicating Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull s efforts to pass legislation. Turnbull does not have a majority in the Senate and has relied on Xenophon s party, the fourth largest bloc in the upper house, to pass legislation.  Xenophon s replacement will come from his party, which bears his name, but is likely to be a far less experienced compared with Xenophon s nine years as a Senator.  Xenophon was a known quantity, he was experienced and as he saw, Turnbull could work with him,  said Peter Chen, senior lecturer in politics at the University of Sydney.   His potential replacement will be inexperienced, and that can be unpredictable. This will not be Turnbull s preferred choice.   Xenophon s future as a Senator was under a cloud due to him holding possible dual citizenship with Britain. Under the constitution a lawmaker must only hold Australian citizenship to be eligible to be elected to the national parliament. Xenophon had renounced his Greek citizenship, which he received from his mother, but had not been aware he held possible British citizenship. While he was born in Australia, his father was born in Cyprus, which was a British colony until independence in 1960. Xenophon s citizenship issue was due to be determined by Australia s High Court. Australia s High Court will next week rule on the eligibility of seven politicians, including Xenophon and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce. Should Joyce be ruled ineligible, Turnbull will lose his majority in the lower house. In announcing his surprise resignation, Xenophon said he would stand for election in his home state of South Australia next year. State parliaments do not have the same citizenship rule as the national parliament.  I have increasingly concluded that you can t fix South Australia s problems in Canberra without first fixing our political system at home. South Australia politics is broken and politically bankrupt,  Xenophon told reporters in Adelaide. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

No wonder Bill went elsewhere to fulfill his “sexual addiction,” as Dolly referred to it. After all, what else can you do when you’re married to a stinky woman who doesn’t shower and isn’t attracted to men anyways? Although an affair is never justified, it’s easy to sympathize with Bill on this one. But, I digress. 
The bigger point here is what the two are willing to do in order to remain in power. Most people know that you can’t trust Hillary as far as you can throw her – which isn’t very far – so the fact that she has any supporters is beyond baffling at this point. This woman is corrupt and fake to the core. Let’s just hope all of America wakes up to this reality before it’s too late and she can do any more damage than she already has. 
Bill and Hillary Clinton just can’t stay out of the spotlight these days, and the most recent leak about them could be the most damaging yet. As it turns out, someone once close to the duo just came forward to share Bill’s revealing nickname for his wife — but the worse comes as their dirty bedroom habits were exposed. 
It’s no mystery that Bill Clinton is a sexual deviant, but the most recent account given by the woman who had a 3-decade affair with the man is damning, to say the least. According to an exclusive interview given to Mail Online, Dolly Kyle was behind the scene’s long enough to not only know the two’s darkest secrets but even their dirty sexual habits – and now, she’s telling everyone. 
The connection between Dolly and Bill began when she was just 11-years-old. He was about 13-years-old at the time, but Dolly states that there was an immediate attraction, even then. As the years progressed, the two became romantically involved and stayed that way through several of their marriages over the next 30 years. 
The real affair began in 1974 just after Dolly divorced her first husband, and although Bill wasn’t married yet, he would be within the year. Although she was never interested in sharing the intimate details of the relationship, she states that she snapped when she heard Hillary recently say that all sexual assault victims have the “right to be believed.” 
Knowing full well just what Hillary had done – between the threats and the lies – to the many women who either had an affair with or were sexually assaulted by her husband Bill, Dolly knew she had to do something about it. Unfortunately for Hillary, Dolly is now coming forward with the dirty 2-word nickname Bill husband once called Hillary, among other things. 
According to Mail Online, Bill approached Dolly at their high school’s 35-year reunion to talk about “ the warden” – a.k.a. Hillary. Saying he was unhappy with his life and marriage, this was the least significant account Dolly had to share. 
In fact, Dolly recalls that Bill mentioned something about having a baby to her. Although she thought he was saying he wanted to have one with her, he was actually talking about Hillary. He wanted to put to bed the rumors that Hillary was a lesbian, even though everyone in their hometown already knew it to be true. 
Dolly states that the worst came when she met Hillary for the first time. “In that moment I noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering [body] odor of perspiration and greasy hair. I hoped that I wouldn’t gag when she got in my car,” she said. “The sandal-shod woman with lank, smelly hair stood off to the side and glared at everyone.”

He went on:  Trump and his National Security Team have closely examined our vetting procedures for countries with ISIS strongholds and continue to take action to stop ISIS from exploiting our country’s immigration system and refugee programs. They have made several updates to these efforts, including, allowing citizens from adequately vetted countries like Iraq to travel to the United States, and ensuring that people who have been granted green cards can travel to and from our country. . @POTUS’ new Executive Order is meant to secure our country  protect all Americans and refugees from our shared enemy. pic. twitter.   —   David Perdue (@sendavidperdue) March 6, 2017,  Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said the executive order reflects the president’s concern for the safety of the American people. “We must undertake a rigorous review of our visa and refugee vetting programs to increase our confidence in the entry decisions we make for visitors and immigrants to the United States. We cannot risk the prospect of malevolent actors using our immigration system to take American lives,” he said. “The executive order signed today is prospective in nature —  applying only to foreign nationals outside of the United States who do not have a valid visa,” Kelly said. “It is important to note that nothing in this executive order affects current lawful permanent residents or persons with current authorization to enter our country,” he said. “If you have a current valid visa to travel, we welcome you.

That original executive order was challenged in the courts, and a federal judge blocked the administration from enforcing it. The new executive order tightens up the loose ends from the Jan. 27 order and reflects a more robust staff process now that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is confirmed and in place along with other key staffers. Trump also dropped Iraq from the order after its government pledged to partner with the American government vetting immigrants and refugees from there. Perdue said the changes from the withdrawn executive order are focused on the real job of the president. “These updates underscore President Trump’s intent to responsibly secure our country and protect all Americans and refugees from our shared enemy, ISIS. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Like many habits, the pursuit of good sushi can get expensive. At the extreme end, the cost includes airfare to Tokyo and bribes to hotel concierges. Even for New Yorkers who stick close to home, the price of keeping up to date on sushi is high and climbing.   sushi nuts have already had the $145 omakase and been served on both sides of the counter by the profoundly courtly employees of Kosaka tried Sushi Zo’s $200 omakase, the rice almost invisible under very long and very soft and unadorned ribbons of fish sat down to Ichimura’s $300 sonata of fish cured and seasoned in an emphatic style that descends from the days before refrigeration and handed over as much as $400 to  Sushi Ginza Onodera for nigiri and other dishes that are as minutely detailed as the interior is soaringly grand. For sushi chasers whose bank accounts are not   this all gets kind of depressing. Or consider the novice fan, who has begun to realize that there are realms of pleasure out there beyond tuna rolls from Duane Reade. What’s next? Sugarfish by Sushi Nozawa would like to be the answer. It’s not, but enough people believe it is, or want to believe, that getting inside this    restaurant on East 20th Street can be a test of patience. Sugarfish arrived with an    pedigree. Its branches around Los Angeles have an ardent following, and one of the chain’s founders, Kazunori Nozawa, was among the first sushi chefs to bring to that city a rigorously autocratic style. Specializing in omakase, he was known to yell at those foolish enough to stir wasabi into their soy sauce. Nobody yelled at me at Sugarfish, but the staff didn’t seem all that eager to feed me, either. I made my first assault on the host stand just after 6:30 one weeknight. (The place doesn’t do reservations.) I was alone and willing to wait even if it took until closing time  —   11 that night. What an optimist I was in those days. “We’re not taking any more names tonight,” a host announced. Later, I learned to stage my raids between 2 and 4 in the afternoon, not hours when I typically crave raw fish. One lucky day, I was in within 30 minutes and out before sunset. One can order sushi by the piece, but the servers and the printed menu heavily push the three “Trust Me” meals. This is a variant on omakase, which roughly means “I trust the chef,” but a Trust Me is not an omakase meal. It is, essentially, a set menu served in waves. All three start with chilled edamame and slices of tuna in ponzu, move on to several small courses of nigiri and end with a hand roll or two. The simplest, Trust Me Lite, is $27 and includes four pieces of nigiri the most expensive is the Nozawa Trust Me, with 12 pieces of sushi and two hand rolls at a price of $51. Each course zooms out of a window in the kitchen where sushi is made with unusual speed. Efficiency lets Sugarfish keep prices low, the volume high and the rice warm  —   a hallmark of what the critic Jonathan Gold has termed the School of Nozawa. The rice is not only warm. It’s seasoned with so much vinegar that it’s almost pickled. This makes it appealingly energetic, a quality that sets it apart from the rest of the food. The fish is uniformly soft and pretty, but none of it tastes much like fish. Sweet shrimp and sea scallops were both exactly as they should be. But there was no heft to the tuna, no depth to the salmon, and anybody who happens to like     species like mackerel or sardines is in the wrong restaurant. The menu and website make much of Mr. Nozawa’s connections among elite fishmongers, but the selection at Sugarfish rarely rises above entry level. The menu lists certain specials “when available. ” Sea urchin is one the last time I went, there wasn’t any. This has to be the only sushi restaurant in New York that can’t get its hands on sea urchin. Fresh wasabi may be too much to ask at Sugarfish’s prices, but there is no wasabi at all under the fish. This is weird. Where sushi is concerned, wasabi isn’t just a condiment. It’s the air in the tires. Sugarfish lets you apply your own from some concentric bloops of stuff that tastes like watery horseradish and looks like a green version of the poop emoji, without the smile. By the end of my third meal, I was desperate for some break in the monotony.

0,WELFake Dataset,"House Speaker John Boehner’s stunning announcement that he will resign his post and seat in Congress sparked chaos on Capitol Hill Friday, with lawmakers immediately jockeying for position ahead of the upcoming reshuffle.

“This is going to be a barn burner of a leadership election,” one source said.

The 13-term Ohio Republican shocked his GOP caucus early Friday morning when he informed them in a closed-door session that he intends to step down at the end of October. One lawmaker told Fox News he was ""stunned,"" and that there was ""some anger"" in the room ""against the people who caused this to happen.""

But the drama didn't stop the almost-immediate scramble for his gavel.

Some lawmakers swiftly hit the phones, making intense calls as they jockeyed for position ahead of what could potentially be an overhaul of the entire leadership team.

The immediate favorite to inherit the gavel is House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., a Boehner ally. Fox News is told he's actively seeking the post.

Asked about a potential successor, Boehner said that's ""up to the members"" but then gave McCarthy a near-endorsement: ""I think Kevin McCarthy would be an excellent speaker.""

But it is far from a done deal, with Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas; Rep. Pete Roskam, R-Ill.; and  Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., thought to be potential candidates who could throw their hats into the ring.

Fox News learned late Friday that Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash. and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La, are both looking at running for the leadership position.

The leadership battle also begins as Congress still struggles over a budget measure and efforts by conservatives to defund Planned Parenthood as part of it. Even if that issue is resolved in the near-term, the next speaker will confront those same partisan divisions.

Not everyone wants that responsibility. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the party's vice presidential nominee in 2012, has already ruled himself out of the race, calling the job “a great job for empty nesters.”

For his part, Roskam attempted to become whip after then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost his primary race last June, and was replaced in leadership by McCarthy – then the majority whip. However, Roskam was beaten by Scalise.

Fox News understands Roskam is one of the lawmakers jockeying for position. When asked for comment, Roskam warned against merely “reshuffling the deck.”

""I'm for somebody who can bridge the divide in our Conference. If we don't have a plan to get us out of this dysfunction, reshuffling the deck won't make anything better. I'm going to work hard to make sure we get the leadership we need, not just settle on the fastest, easiest choice,"" Roskam said.

An aide to Hensarling told Fox News that he was considering his options and would expect to have a decision next week.

Should McCarthy succeed Boehner, there would be an opening for House majority leader, as well as potentially further down the roster in positions such as majority whip.

Boehner’s backing may help McCarthy’s chances with the establishment, but may hurt him elsewhere.

“[Boehner’s backing] will help him with the establishment but not with the conservative House Freedom Caucus. He may face a challenge [from conservatives] but even the House Freedom Caucus admit they aren’t organized, and so they may not even put up a candidate,” GOP strategist Ron Bonjean told FoxNews.com. “Speed is the key. Waiting can hurt your chances. Members who can get members behind them can build momentum, and a snowball effect allows them to wrap things up. That’s what McCarthy is going for – there’s already a sense of inevitability that he’s getting the job.”

If conservatives do put forward a candidate of their own, Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio and Rep. Ted Yoho R-Fla., are among the names that could be put forward.

Democrats, too, will almost certainly run Boehner’s predecessor -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. -- for the post.

At a press conference Friday afternoon with Chinese President Xi Jinping, President Obama also voiced his own general hopes for the next speaker:

“My hope is there’s a recognition on the part of the next speaker, something I think John understood … that we can have significant differences on issues but that doesn’t mean you shut down the government,” Obama said.

Boehner's resignation could make next week's budget battle easier to resolve in the short-term. Conservatives want to use the budget measure to defund Planned Parenthood, and Boehner previously had to worry about an internal party revolt if he tried to strike a deal with Democrats to pass a ""clean"" budget bill.

However, it also could work the other way. A lame-duck Boehner could open a situation where aspiring GOP leaders are put on the spot and under even more pressure from the conservative wing.

Once Boehner resigns, the total number of members in the House will be 434. An absolute majority of the House is required to elect a new speaker, not a simple majority -- meaning the magic number of votes that a candidate must get is 218.

Once Boehner resigns, the House will be unable to do anything until it elects a new speaker.

Boehner’s resignation is rare, but not unprecedented. The last speaker to resign in the middle of a Congress was Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas who resigned in 1989 amid an ethics scandal.

Steven Kolb, CFDA president and CEO,  said supporting Planned Parenthood is a “civic responsibility. ” “Defunding Planned Parenthood will impact millions of Americans,” he added. “We will raise awareness and support this fashion week and show that Fashion Stands with Planned Parenthood. ” According to CFDA, more than 40 designers and brands are participating in the campaign, “including Diane von Furstenberg, Carolina Herrera, Cushnie et Ochs, Public School, Jonathan Simkhai, kate spade new york, Rosetta Getty, Proenza Schouler, Mara Hoffman, Narciso Rodriguez, Milly, Prabal Gurung, Tory Burch, and Zac Posen. ” “We are truly thrilled by the Council of Fashion Designers of America’s show of support for Planned Parenthood at New York Fashion Week,” said Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards in response. “Planned Parenthood has stood defiantly in the face of opposition for a century, and we’re not backing down now. ” “The American people overwhelmingly support our organization and strongly oppose ‘defunding’ care at our health centers,” she continued. “Planned Parenthood’s millions of supporters, including the CFDA, are mobilizing to protect access to reproductive health and rights for everyone, including the 2. 5 million patients we serve, and we will continue to fight to ensure that all people can get the care they need. ” However, a recent Marist poll found that 61 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion, including 40 percent of those who say they are “” and 41 percent of Democrats. The House recently approved the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, a measure that would permanently prohibit taxpayer dollars from being used to fund abortions and would make the Hyde Amendment permanent across all federal expenditures. “House passage of this legislation is the first step towards fulfilling a promise made by President Trump to keep taxpayers out of the abortion business,” said   Susan B. Anthony President Marjorie Dannenfelser. “He and his administration are working for the American people, not the abortion lobby. We urge the U. S. Senate to follow suit so that this bill can get to President Trump’s desk as soon as possible. ” According to NYMag. com, CFDA board member Tracy Reese said, “So many people stand with Planned Parenthood  —   including designers and entertainers  —   because they and their loved ones have relied on Planned Parenthood for health care, including   care like cancer screenings, birth control, STI testing and treatment and sex education. ” “Planned Parenthood is often the only option for this type of care in underserved communities,” she added. “By creating a visually engaging and fashionable pin, we hope to create an organic social media movement promoting awareness and education. ” Planned Parenthood, however, does not provide mammograms, and in  a new video series,   group Live Action is challenging the abortion business’s claim that it provides “  care. ” Live Action’s investigators seeking “  care” contacted 97 Planned Parenthood clinics across the country and were told at 92 of them that “  services” were not available. Similarly, investigators discovered that Planned Parenthood staff members admitted ultrasounds are only done prior to abortions and not for   care. “The reality is Planned Parenthood’s focus for pregnant women is abortion,” Live Action President Lila Rose said at a press conference on Capitol Hill Thursday. “It’s not   care. It’s not serving young mothers, promoting them, supporting them it’s abortion. ”   leaders and members of Congress also point out that federally qualified healthcare centers (FQHCs) provide more comprehensive medical and family planning services than Planned Parenthood to   women and families. Nationally, there are 13, 000 FQHCs  —   a figure that outnumbers Planned Parenthood facilities by 20 to 1. Republicans plan to redirect Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding to these thousands of other health centers that do not provide abortion.

Middleton retired in August after teaching at the law school for 17 years. But he subsequently worked with the black protestors who created racial tensions by staging a series of direct actions designed to antagonize other students.Middleton is featured prominently in a video released three weeks ago called  Response To Skeptics,  which was produced by a video team at the university s Academic Support Center.The video opens with Jonathan Butler   the lead activist   leveling political charge at people who don t accept the black activists  claim of  racial problems  at the campus, which is located only 120 miles from Ferguson, where the current protests and political campaign began in August 2014.Then Middleton appears, to insist there is a race-relations problem because race-activists say there is a race-relations problem. How can anyone deny there s a race relations issue on this campus? Are they not listening to the people who are saying their is? Are they calling all these people liars? That s as bad as calling all of them racist? This is a problem because a huge part of our community agrees that it s a problem.

So in other words, soon it won t matter if these illegal alien teachers are able to speak english as long as they want to  do the right thing? Gov. Brian Sandoval signed a bill Wednesday that would make it easier for immigrants with temporary legal status to get a Nevada teaching license, saying it would help meet the needs of a  new Nevada. Among the people who flanked the Republican governor as he signed AB27 was Uriel Garcia, a 22-year-old Nevada State College student and recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program who was previously denied a license. He said he plans to re-apply as soon as possible to get started on his student teaching and move toward his goal of teaching 2nd grade English language learners. I want to give back to the community that gave me so much,  Garcia said.The old law allowed the state superintendent to give a teaching license to someone who is not a citizen but has a work permit only if there s a teacher shortage for a subject the person can teach. The new law, which passed the Senate and Assembly unanimously, allows those immigrants to get a teaching license if a district has a teacher shortage of any kind.The measure affects immigrants in the deferred action program, also known as DACA recipients or DREAMers. State Superintendent Dale Erquiaga said it s not clear how many new teachers the change will yield, but said his office will track that number going forward.Proponents framed the bill as a way to deal with a major teacher shortage, as well as a way to diversify the teaching force in a state with a high population of English language learners. We re going to have people who are bilingual teachers, and ultimately people who just want to do the right thing for the United States,  Garcia said.Sylvia Lazos, vice chair of the Latino Leadership Council, said the bill better reflects a changing Nevada. These laws that prohibit non-citizens from getting licensed come from another era, another time, when many states were hostile to Germans, Catholics, Irish,  Lazos said.

0,WELFake Dataset,"If one were to count up the number of times any American  —   or maybe anyone anywhere  —   laughed in the last   the person responsible for more of those laughs than anyone else might well be Garry Marshall, who died at 81 on Tuesday in Burbank, Calif. It would be difficult to overstate Mr. Marshall’s effect on American entertainment. His work in network television and Hollywood movies fattened the archive of romantic, family and buddy comedies and consistently found the sweet spot smack dab in the middle of the mainstream. Indeed, Mr. Marshall was one of the forces directing that mainstream, working with   stars from the 1960s (Lucille Ball and Danny Thomas, among others) into the early years of the 21st century (Anne Hathaway, for instance, whom he directed in the      film “The Princess Diaries”). Beginning in the ‘60s, his television work alone included writing scripts for the     comedies “Make Room for Daddy” (with Mr. Thomas) “The Lucy Show” and “The Dick Van Dyke Show. ” In 1970, with Jerry Belson, a frequent early writing partner, he adapted Neil Simon’s play “The Odd Couple” into the ABC television series of the same name, starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman as the mismatched roommates, the neatnik Felix and the slob Oscar. Mr. Marshall went on to create, in 1974, “Happy Days,” a fondly nostalgic parody of   life in the 1950s and early ’60s featuring a roster of stereotypical young people, including Ron Howard as Richie, the straight arrow, and Henry Winkler as the rebellious,   charmer known as the Fonz. (The lawyer Martin Garbus, who was a friend of Mr. Marshall’s from their early teens, and who confirmed the death, said in an interview that he was the model for Richie and that the other characters in the show were generally based on Mr. Marshall’s friends from the Bronx, though “Happy Days” was set in Milwaukee.) A hit in itself, the show begat other hits. One featured the charmingly innocent, logorrheic space alien Mork, from Ork, played by Robin Williams, who appeared in a “Happy Days” episode in early 1978 and became the central character in “Mork  Mindy,” a show created by Mr. Marshall with Joe Glauberg and Dale McRaven. They set Mork down in Boulder, Colo. where he befriends a young woman, played by Pam Dawber, who patiently teaches him the ways of earthlings and eventually marries him. “Happy Days” lent another   show, “Laverne  Shirley,” both a setting and its main characters. Created by Mr. Marshall with Lowell Ganz and Mark Rothman, it was about a pair of   single women  —   Laverne DeFazio, played by Mr. Marshall’s younger sister Penny, and Shirley Feeney, played by Cindy Williams  —   who work at a brewery. They had been introduced to the “Happy Days” audience when they went on a double date with the Fonz and Richie. “Garry Marshall had a feel for Everyman,   comedy that matched exactly the young,   audience that made up the base of ABC’s appeal,” Bill Carter, the former longtime television reporter for The New York Times and now a commentator for CNN, said in an email. “He was the dominant figure in the rise of that long downtrodden network to a run of ratings supremacy in the 1970s. It was the first time ABC had ever ascended to the top of television. ” Mr. Marshall began directing movies in the 1980s. Several were   star vehicles that dealt with mismatched pairs: “Nothing in Common” (1986) a reconciliation story with Jackie Gleason and Tom Hanks as cantankerous father and resentful son “Overboard” (1987) which proposes that a meanspirited heiress with amnesia (Goldie Hawn) can be persuaded to believe she is the wife of a carpenter (Kurt Russell) and, most famously, “Pretty Woman” (1990) a Cinderella tale  —   and a gigantic hit  —   set in contemporary Los Angeles, about a hooker with a heart of gold (Julia Roberts) and her Prince Charming, a ruthless corporate raider (Richard Gere). Mr. Marshall once confessed that he wanted to be “the Norman Rockwell of television. ” “I like to do very romantic, sentimental type of work,” he told The  Times as “Pretty Woman” was being released. “It’s a dirty job, but somebody has to do it. ” As an actor, Mr. Marshall appeared frequently in small roles, cast usually to take advantage of his casually blunt manner and distinctly nasal Bronx accent, perhaps best exemplified by a scene in Albert Brooks’s comedy “Lost in America” (1985) in which he played a Las Vegas casino manager whom Mr. Brooks harangues in an attempt to get him to return the money he lost gambling. When Mr. Brooks says the casino could be like the Gimbels department store in the Christmas movie “Miracle on 34th Street,” profiting from an act of beneficence, Mr. Marshall is the personification of flabbergasted. “In that movie, Santy Claus took care of everything,” he says in the film. “There was Macy’s, Gimbels, but Santy Claus came and he fixed the whole thing. We don’t have Santy Claus. ” Garry Kent Marshall was born in the Bronx on Nov. 13, 1934. His father, who was born Anthony Masciarelli but changed the family name, made industrial films. Mr. Marshall recalled them in an interview in 2000 with the Archive of American Television. “‘The Story of Zinc,’ ‘Smelting in the Pittsburgh Mill’  —   we watched them,” he said. “Not one laugh. ” His mother, the former Marjorie Ward, taught dance classes in the basement of their apartment building. She was also the family wit, Mr. Marshall said, who introduced him to   humor, “which became one of the great tools of humor throughout my career. ” “My mother was funnier than anybody I ever worked for,” he said in the 2000 interview, fingering his sport jacket. “My father was as funny as this coat. Not a laugh a minute, my father. ” As a boy, Mr. Marshall learned to play the drums, and he was a good athlete a shortstop, he admired Phil Rizzuto of the Yankees and was known as Flip, he said, for the way he tossed the ball. He used that nickname later when he performed in nightclubs. Adding his father’s former surname, he called himself Flip Masciarelli  —   a creative hiccup away from the name of one of his   characters, Arthur Fonzarelli, a. k. a. the Fonz. Mr. Marshall attended Public School 80 and DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx and graduated from Northwestern University, where, he recalled in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in May, “I realized words mattered and I studied journalism. ” When his mother died in 1983, Mr. Marshall and his family donated $1 million to Northwestern to name a building in his mother’s name: The Marjorie Ward Marshall Dance Center. Mr. Marshall joined the Army in 1956 and served in South Korea before returning to New York, where he worked briefly for The Daily News, did his comedy routines at night and wrote jokes for the comedian Joey Bishop and others. In the early 1960s he moved to Los Angeles, where he met a nurse, Barbara Sue Wells they married in 1963. In addition to her, his survivors include a son, Scott two daughters, Lori and Kathleen two sisters, Ms. Marshall, the actor and director, and Ronny Hallin, a producer and six grandchildren. Mr. Marshall wrote episodes for many of the shows he created, and he contributed to other   series, including “Gomer Pyle: U. S. M. C.,” a spinoff of “The Andy Griffith Show,” starring Jim Nabors the buddy adventure drama “I Spy,” with Robert Culp and Bill Cosby and the omnibus sitcom “Love, American Style. ” Not all of his series were big winners. Among his   and less successful were “Hey Landlord,” about a young man from Ohio who inherits a New York apartment building “Me and the Chimp,” about a dentist (Ted Bessell) and his family, who adopt, well, a chimp “Angie,” about a waitress (Donna Pescow) who marries a wealthy young doctor (Robert Hays) and “Joanie Loves Chachi,” another “Happy Days” spinoff, starring Erin Moran and Scott Baio. Mr. Marshall’s other films include “Beaches” (1988) a melodrama about the trials and tribulations of a   friendship between two women, played by Barbara Hershey and Bette Midler “Frankie and Johnny” (1991) based on a play by Terrence McNally, about the courtship of a waitress (Michelle Pfeiffer) by a persistent     cook (Al Pacino) “Runaway Bride” (1999) a   reuniting Ms. Roberts and Mr. Gere as a      repeat offender and the journalist who writes about her and, in his last few years, a handful of comedies with   ensembles telling a variety of stories revolving around holidays: “Valentine’s Day” (2010) New Year’s Eve” (2011) and “Mother’s Day” (2016). A theater buff, Mr. Marshall built a   performance space in Burbank, Calif. and opened it as the Falcon Theater in 1997 it began a   subscription series in 2002. He also tried his hand at playwriting, with limited success. His   play, “Wrong Turn at Lungfish,” written with Lowell Ganz, was a bittersweet   comedy about a dying, sightless and cantankerous old intellectual, a perky, uneducated young woman who volunteers to read to him, and her lunkhead of a boyfriend. It was presented at Steppenwolf in Chicago and in 1993 Off Broadway, directed by Mr. Marshall with George C. Scott, Jami Gertz and Tony Danza in the leading roles. Mr. Marshall is the author of two memoirs, both written with his daughter Lori: “Wake Me When It’s Funny: How to Break Into Show Business and Stay” (1995) and “My Happy Days in Hollywood” (2012). “Critics have knocked me for targeting society’s lowest common denominator,” Mr. Marshall said in the earlier book. “I believe that television was, and still is, the only medium that can truly reach society’s lowest common denominator and entertain those people who maybe can’t afford a movie or a play. So why not reach them and do it well? “When I produced a television show I didn’t just roll out of bed each morning and say, ‘I’m going to make some rich, smart and successful people laugh.’ I thought, ‘Let them get their own laughs.’ They have the money to pay for it. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"The wife of Fox News co-owner James Murdoch, made no secret of her dislike for Steve Bannon back in April of 2017: Enough of President Bannon. President Jarvanka preferable.  Kathryn Murdoch (@KathrynAMurdoch) April 5, 2017Are the Murdoch family about to be sorry they ever wished for Steve Bannon to be fired or to resign from his position? According to Axios: Steve Bannon is about to becoe a very big threat to the Murdoch Brothers conservative-leaning network news monopoly.Unshaven and working from home in cargo shorts as he moves into  Bannon the Barbarian  mode, Steve Bannon is thinking bigger than Breitbart.Axios  Jonathan Swan hears Bannon has told friends he sees a massive opening to the right of Fox News, raising the possibility that he s going to start a network.Bannon s friends are speculating about whether it will be a standalone TV network, or online streaming only. Before his death in May, Roger Ailes had sent word to Bannon that he wanted to start a channel together. Bannon loved the idea: He believes Fox is heading in a squishy, globalist direction as the Murdoch sons assume more power. Now he has the means, motive and opportunity: His chief financial backer, Long Island hedge fund billionaire Bob Mercer, is ready to invest big in what s coming next, including a huge overseas expansion of Breitbart News. On Day 1, Bannon declared he s taking his West Wing infighting to the outside, telling Bloomberg Businessweek s Josh Green that he s  going to war for Trump against his opponents   on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America. The reality is that Bannon will go nuclear on former colleagues he calls  West Wing Democrats : economic adviser Gary Cohn, Jared and Ivanka ( Javanka,  as he calls them) and Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell.The revved-up Breitbart operation is also likely to target Speaker Ryan, as it did before Trump.Why it matters: The country s national political conversation is about to get even uglier, if you can imagine. It s going to be dark, and toxic, with a fight on the right that may be more bitter and personal than hostilities between Republicans and Democrats.Will Steve Bannon be more useful to the conservative movement on the outside? Will he use his experiences in the White House and his vast knowledge in the world of conservative media to build a media empire that could crush the Murdoch s FOX News network? Many Americans will be wondering Will Bannon hire Bill O Reilly, the one man who kept Fox News at the top of the ratings for over a decade? President Trump wished Steve Bannon well in his return to Breitbart News. Is it possible Trump knew of Bannon s plans to build a right-leaning media empire that could take down the leftist fake news monopoly we currently see in America?100 Percent FED UP  With the liberal sons of Rupert Murdoch now firmly at the helm of what once was a conservative-leaning alternative to leftist cable news shows like CNN, MSNBC and the mainstream media news outlets, there is a very good chance Americans are witnessing the end of a significant era where FOX News ruled the ratings and liberal-run propaganda networks only dreamed of the kind of revenue they were pulling down.It is difficult to exaggerate the significance of Fox News  sacking of Bill O Reilly.Not only was he the single most dominant public figure in America s vast conservative media environment, his removal signals the growing power of James and Lachlan Murdoch in the world s most powerful media empire, their father Rupert Murdoch s 21st Century Fox.O Reilly was dismissed overnight following allegations of sexual harassment by at least six women. It has been reported that Lachlan s wife Sarah Murdoch helped influence the decision. Last year the former Fox News creator, Roger Ailes, was sacked in similar circumstances, going on to advise Donald Trump s presidential campaign.Murdoch s support for Trump distinguishes him from some of his children, including James, who told more than one friend of his dismay that his father was backing the Trump candidacy. James s wife, Kathryn, backed Hillary Clinton during the campaign and has been a vocal critic of the new president on Twitter. In September Kathryn tweeted:  A vote for Trump is a vote for climate catastrophe , while on the night of the president s stunning election victory she wrote:  I can t believe this is happening. I am so ashamed. James and Kathryn are committed environmentalists: she is on the board of the Environmental Defense Fund, which a Fox News report recently labelled a  leftwing group , while James wrote in The Washington Post in 2009 that  conservation-minded conservatives  were  missing in the heated partisanship of today s politics .

0,WELFake Dataset,"MUNICH (Reuters) - A new version of a Trump administration travel ban will not stop green card residency holders or travelers already on planes from entering the United States, U.S. Secretary for Homeland Security John Kelly said on Saturday. U.S. President Donald Trump’s initial attempt to clamp down for security reasons on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and on refugees snarled to a halt amid a judicial backlash and chaos at airports. “The president is contemplating releasing a tighter, more streamlined version of the first (order). And I will have opportunity to work (on) a rollout plan, in particular to make sure that there’s no one in a sense caught in the system of moving from overseas to our airports,” Kelly said at the Munich Security Conference. Asked whether green card residency permit holders would be allowed in, Kelly said: “It’s a good assumption and, as far as the visas go, ... if they’re in motion from some distant land to the United States, when they arrive they will be allowed in.”  He promised “a short phase-in period to make sure that people on the other end don’t get on airplanes. But if they’re on an airplane and inbound, they’ll be allowed to enter the country.” A draft of the replacement executive order shows that the administration aims to put restrictions on citizens of the same seven Muslim-majority countries covered by the initial order, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cites an internal State Department memo. The replacement order could be issued as early as Tuesday, the Journal reported, citing a U.S. government official. The administration would seek to implement the new order a week to two weeks after it is signed, and covers citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, the Journal said. Trump’s original order, which he said was meant to head off attacks by Islamist militants, barred people from those same countries from entering for 90 days and excluded all refugees for 120 days, except those from Syria, who were banned indefinitely. The abrupt implementation of the order last month plunged the immigration system into chaos, sparking a wave of criticism from the countries affected, and from Western allies and some of America’s leading corporations, especially technology firms.

Not only is he well on his way to ruining an entire country (and already has made a pretty big dent in that goal), but he has singlehandedly brought down the value of his own brand thanks to his idiocy and unpopular rhetoric.The Trump name is now so hated that even his most beloved family member, his daughter Ivanka, is suffering for her father s madness and erratic behavior. Recently, retail giant Nordstrom decided to pull Ivanka s brand from its inventory due to declining sales, and a pesky anti-Trump boycotting campaign called  Grab Your Wallet.  Here s what Nordtrom s president, Pete Nordstrom, had originally said about dropping Ivanka s line: This is a sharply divisive subject. No matter what we do, we are going to end up disappointing some of our customers. Every single brand we offer is evaluated on their results   if people don t buy it, we won t sell it. In response, Trump threw an insane temper tantrum and tweeted this: My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person   always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! The company has now responded, and the way they handled it was perfect. Indirectly addressing Trump s immature response to their decision to drop Ivanka s brand, Nordstrom issued a brilliantly diplomatic statement that remained professional without feeding Trump s insane narcissistic need for attention..@PressSec says @Nordstrom removing Ivanka s clothing line was an attack on Trump family. This is what company says. pic.twitter.com/5i7zhuGBgv  Jeff Zeleny (@jeffzeleny) February 8, 2017It s a subtle hit at Trump, despite not ever acknowledging Trump himself.

I never use emails,  Trump says in the cold opener.  I use a very private, very secure site where one can write whatever they want to and no one can read it It s called Twitter. After he is informed that everyone can see his tweets,  Trump  replies: Really? And I m still in this thing? America you must really hate this lady. After a scathing rebuke of the media s decision to ignore Trump s cozy relationship with Putin, the KKK, and the FBI and instead focus on something as meaningless as Hillary Clinton s emails, something magical happened: McKinnon and Baldwin dropped the facade and got serious. I m sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this,  Baldwin says. I just feel gross all the time about this. Don t you all feel gross?  he added, addressing the audience.McKinnon agrees and the two embark on a  friendship montage  through the city before returning to the stage.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he likely will sign an order this week that is expected to allow Americans to buy stripped-down health insurance policies, a step some experts say would further undermine the Obamacare law that Trump opposes. Unable to win passage of legislation to dismantle the 2010 law in a Congress led by his own party, Trump indicated he would take unilateral action. He offered few specifics beyond saying his action would let people cross state lines to obtain “great, competitive healthcare” costing the United States “nothing.” The expected order would allow small businesses and individuals to band together as associations to buy health insurance plans that would be exempt from some Obamacare requirements. These include mandatory coverage for 10 essential health benefits such as maternity and newborn care, prescription drugs and mental health treatment.  It would also expand the amount of time people can use short-term medical insurance plans, which are cheaper than traditional plans but cover a limited set of benefits. People could use those plans for up to a year, compared to three months under current law.  “I’ll also be signing something, probably this week, which is going to go a long way to take care of many of the people that have been so badly hurt on healthcare,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “With Congress the way it is, I decided to take it upon myself,” Trump added, saying the plan is “largely worked out.” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump will make his announcement “by the end of Friday.” Trump said his action would let insurers sell across state lines. The association health plans, for instance, could be sold from a state with fewer benefit requirements. Such insurance policies could be cheaper than those that provide the full range of medical coverage required under Obamacare, potentially making them attractive to people in other states. It is unclear when these plans would become available. It is unlikely consumers could sign up for these plans during the 2018 open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1.  Experts questioned Trump’s authority to issue such an order that would exempt some plans but not others from Obamacare rules rather than pursuing the changes through legislation. The action could open Trump to legal challenges from Democratic state attorneys general, who have said they will sue Trump if he tries to destroy Obamacare. The plans allowed under the order could lure young and healthy people away from the individual insurance markets created by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare. That could further destabilize those markets, where insurers have already exited the markets altogether, pared back offerings or hiked premiums because of uncertainty caused by the Trump administration.  Experts said Trump’s plan could leave behind only the sickest people in the Obamacare markets, raising premiums and effectively eroding the law’s protection that people with pre-existing medical conditions cannot be charged more. “There’s a general belief that at every turn the federal government is going to create regulations to hurt rather than help the markets,” said Craig Garthwaite, director of the healthcare program at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, referring to the Trump administration.  “It unwinds the ability of people with pre-existing conditions to get insurance under the ACA,” Garthwaite said. Republicans have failed to make good on their seven-year promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, the signature domestic policy achievement of Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. Gutting Obamacare was a top Trump campaign promise. Trump, who has called the law a failure and vowed to let it “implode,” has undermined Obamacare through regulatory and administrative actions. Last week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a rule that will let businesses and non-profit organizations lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law’s mandate that employers provide birth control for women in health insurance with no co-payment. Trump has declined to commit to making payments guaranteed to insurers under Obamacare. The payments are estimated to be about $7 billion this year and help lower out-of-pocket medical costs for low-income consumers. Insurers have cited that uncertainty in exiting insurance markets or hiking premiums.  His administration has slashed the Obamacare advertising budget, halved the open enrollment period and cut funding to groups that help sign people up for insurance under the law.

0,WELFake Dataset,"A struggling mom sent an email to all 122 of Mississippi s lawmakers asking for help getting insulin and an insulin pump for her diabetic daughter. This was after she called 23 suppliers, trying to find one that would take Medicaid following her former supplier s move out of Medicaid s network. Her daughter has Type 1 diabetes, and needs six to ten insulin injections per day just to live.Nicole Nichols  was flabbergasted  when she received this response from State Representative Jeffrey Guice: I am sorry for your problem. Have you thought about buying the supplies with money that you earn? Wow. A struggling mom gets desperate and emails her lawmakers for help, and she gets slapped down with a horrifically insensitive reply from someone who doesn t know squat about her or her family. Guice is the perfect example of what s wrong with the GOP. The bootstraps crowd over there has a very limited understanding of these things.Guice issued an apology for his terrible response, which actually just reinforces the fact that he doesn t care about anyone outside his little bubble: I realize my remarks to Mrs. Nichols were completely insensitive and out of line I am sorry and deeply regret my reply. I know nothing about her and her family and replied in knee-jerk fashion. I d like to think the people of Mississippi and my constituents know that I m willing to help where I am able. I replied in knee-jerk fashion.  That s basically an admission that he thinks anyone receiving government aid is a lazy good-for-nothing living high on the hog off of the backs of hardworking taxpayers. That s what the entire GOP thinks about people on aid. What an obtuse piece of flotsam.Nichols told her story to the Clarion-Ledger, going into more detail in a video about her situation and why she needs these supplies:Nichols is a stay-at-home mom, but her husband works two jobs to provide for their family of four. The insulin pump, which her daughter needs to avoid having to go through six to ten injections every day, is $2,000. The insulin itself can run as much as $400 per month. Struggling families can t afford that, and no amount of  get a job  is going to change that.Nichols actually did receive two other replies, both of which were sympathetic to her situation. Thankfully, people like Guice aren t calling the shots here. Nichols posted about this on her Facebook page, prompting a barrage of outraged comments from people who read it. Mississippi Medicaid saw her post, actually had some compassion, and reached out to Nichols about this very situation.Guice, and the rest of the GOP, are heartless brutes. He might regret his comments, but the fact that he even made them shows that he s just another one of those who thinks everyone should just magically grow bootstraps with which to pull themselves up.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump has repeatedly insulted women to the point where if only women voted in this election Hillary Clinton would win in a landslide that would give her a mandate.Indeed, Clinton is on pace to do even better with women on November 8th than President Obama did in 2008 and 2012.But just in case there are women out there who have not heard any of the things Trump has said about them, Nikki Reed blasted Trump s misogyny in a new video posted by Humanity For Hillary.In the video, Reed slammed Donald Trump and all the men who support him in an NSFW feminist smackdown that Trump is going to throw a hissy fit about on Twitter for days. This has been a bruising election,  Reed begins.  On the one hand, we have the chance to elect a lifelong public servant, powerful, experienced, highly qualified to be the first female President of the United States. On the other hand, a candidate who reminds us of the worst men in our lives. Men who saw a powerful woman and tried to block her rise. Our rise. Men who called us bossy, unlikable, liars, and attention seekers. Ambitious, like that s a bad thing. Reed went on to talk about how misogynists like Trump attacked women for doing things like writing books and making movies and that when women continued to achieve new heights despite them they started hurling insults like the C-word, a word that Donald Trump has used in the past. I ve been called the C-word,  Reed said.  Have you been called the C-word? Reed then pointed out that there is an anti-Hillary SuperPac called C.U.N.T. and proceeded reference Trump calling Hillary a  nasty woman  by calling upon all nasty women to vote against Trump on Election Day because  we are so very close to putting all of that behind us because nasty women vote. And then she sent a message to Trump and his deplorable sexist supporters. So Donald Trump and to every man like Donald Trump who grabbed us, blocked us, who called us fat, unqualified, stupid, ugly and c*nt, we have one thing to say to you: C. U. Next Tuesday. Here s the video via Facebook.Make no mistake, if this campaign and Donald Trump s life before it are any indication, women will be treated like absolute shit if Trump somehow becomes president. There is no doubt about that whatsoever. That s why is it crucial that women vote on Election Day no matter what. Because if Trump wins, women will lose everything they have fought for over the last 100 years, including the right to vote.Featured image via video screen capture",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

I m going to stress the word  mild  here because it will be held up as an extreme attack on Israel because that s where our political system is today. Any politician that even slightly disagrees with Israel s tendency to shoot first, ask questions never is labeled as the next coming of Hitler by the rabidly pro-Israel right and the slightly less rabid pro-Israel left.

It is interesting that the first Jew in American history to win a delegate, much less a primary, is taking a position on Israel that is Usually in American politics everyone just supports Israel and whatever Israel wants to do. You re taking a more critical position,  Tapper said.It s rare for anyone, much less a journalist, to put it so bluntly so kudos to Tapper as well.

Keeping them deprived of food, medicine and other basic human needs is only natural since they re little better than animals.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Australian taxpayers charged over $88 million for donation to corrupt Clinton Foundation October 31, 2016 Google + They both love to play the gender card, turning their immense privilege into victim status and ­dividing the electorate by sex.
Thus, Gillard nobbled Tony ­Abbott with her fabled misogyny speech and Clinton’s machine manages to drown out every Wikileaks embarrassment with a new Donald Trump bimbo eruption. 
The other thing the two ladies have in common is the Clinton Foundation , which Wikileaks emails now show is an influence-peddling political slush fund. 
And guess which country was one of its biggest donors? Australia. Yep, we’re up there with Saudi Arabia and Qatar. 
The Australian taxpayer shovelled at least $88 million into the Clinton Foundation and associated entities from 2006 to 2014, reaching a peak of $10.3 million in 2012-13, Gillard’s last year in office. Hillary Clinton and Julia Gillard both involved in the influence-peddling political slush fund that is the Clinton Foundation. 
On the Clinton Foundation website, AusAID and the Commonwealth of Australia score separate entries in the $10 million-plus group of donors, one rung up from American teacher unions. 
In 2009-10 Kevin Rudd handed over another $10 million to the foundation for climate research, part of $300 million he squandered on a Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. 
Gillard also donated $300 million of our money to the Clinton-affiliated Global Partnership for Education. 
Lo and behold, she became chairman in 2014 and has been ­actively promoting Clinton as president ever since — in a campaign video last December slamming Trump, in opeds trumpeting the next woman president and in appearances with Clinton spruiking girls’ education. 
The Abbott government topped up the left-wing organisation’s coffers with another $140 million in 2014, bringing total Australian largesse to $460 million, according to a press release from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. 
And yet, apart from the beautiful friendship with Gillard, what did Australia get from the Clintons for all that cash? 
A whole lot of trouble is what. 
The latest treasure trove of Wikileaks emails released last week shows that Australian green groups have been secretly funded to destroy our coal industry by environmental activists connected to the Clinton campaign. Apart from the friendship between Hillary Clinton and Julia Gillard, what does Australia get from the Clinton Foundation for donating all that cash? A whole lot of trouble is what. 
The email account of Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta reveals extraordinary details of the sabotage of the $16 billion Adani coalmine in Queensland, which has damaged Australia’s national interest and denied cheap electricity to millions of poor Indians. 
Last August John Hepburn, former Greenpeace activist and founder of Australian anti-coal group the Sunrise Project, sent a crowing email to his American paymasters, the Sandler Foundation, which is also a major donor to the Clinton Foundation. (Founder Herb Sandler and mate George Soros funded another Clinton-aligned progressive group, the Centre for American Progress, previously chaired by Podesta.) 
“The Adani Carmichael mine and the whole Galilee Basin fossil fuel industrial complex is in its death throes,” Hepburn wrote in the email forwarded to Podesta. 
“I am going to buy a few bottles of bubbly for a celebration with the (Environmental ­Defenders Office) legal team, our colleagues at GetUp, Greenpeace, 350.org, ECF, Australian Youth Climate Coalition, Mackay Conservation Group, Market Forces and the brilliant and tireless Sunrise team.” 
In another email forwarded to Podesta, Hepburn panics about an Abbott government inquiry into environmental charities and discusses hiding Sunrise’s sources of funding to safeguard its charitable tax status. 
Hepburn boasts about the latest legal blow to Adani, when the Federal Court overturned its approval and the Commonwealth Bank quit the project. 
In it he now wants to “escalate the campaign ­towards the other 3 big Australian banks”. 
And he mocks miners who “try to claim that there is some kind of foreign-funded and tightly orchestrated conspiracy to systematically ­destroy the Australian coal industry. (I seriously don’t know where they get these wacky ideas from!)” 
As if it’s not bad enough that foreign-funded activists are meddling with our largest export earner, Podesta’s emails also detail their insidious influence on indigenous land owners who blocked the Adani mine using powerful native title rights. 
This alliance of green groups with native title owners is a frightening development detailed in a new book by historian Keith Windschuttle, The Break-up of Australia: The Real Agenda behind Aboriginal Recognition. 
He reveals the imminent expansion of native title claims, either ­approved or quietly being processed, stretch across a whopping 60 per cent of the Australian continent, an area twice the size of Western Europe. 
Already 6000sq km of the Kidman cattle empire in the Kimberley has been given, via native title, to green activists to be converted from productive cattle country to a wildlife conservation area. 
“In return, the Yulumbu people get a paltry $50,000 a year royalty,” Windschuttle writes. 
“As a flora and fauna sanctuary it is economically defunct for the foreseeable future.” 
At worst, writes Windschuttle, the upcoming referendum for indigenous constitutional recognition, proposed by Gillard in 2012, could pave the way for a separate Aboriginal state on native title land, funded by taxation, royalties and lease payments — passive welfare in another guise. 
At the very least, the ­alliance between foreign-­funded green groups and ­indigenous owners gives ­environmentalists the opportunity to take whole swathes of Australia out of the productive economy and shut down industries they don’t like, from coal mines in Queensland to cattle farms in Western Australia.

Hewitt also lobbed a softball question to Trump (which he actually kind of flubbed) giving him a chance to blast President Obama’s Syria policy, and some of his 2016 rivals for not supporting military intervention in 2013. It looked as if Trump’s campaign against Hewitt as a “third-rate” radio host asking “gotcha” questions – backed by Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter – actually worked.

Oh, if you’re waiting for me to tell you definitively who “won” the debate, and who might begin to rise or fall in the polls as a result? I’m sorry, I really have no idea. Dr. Ben Carson looked like he confused his One-A-Day vitamin with Lunesta; he was barely able to keep his eyes open and talked in sleepy non-sequiturs. But I thought Carson blew the last debate, and he rose in the polls. So what do I know?

Jeb Bush clearly had another mediocre night, which he can’t afford. He came out kind of peppy – even Trump praised his “energy” – and accused Trump of exactly the kind of special interest lobbying he rails against, saying the real estate mogul gave him money back when he ran for governor, and then unsuccessfully lobbied to place casinos in Florida. But Trump denied it and loudly talked over Bush; there was brief confusion about whether the former governor was telling the truth (PolitiFact later confirmed it); and the moment faded.

Likewise, Bush was later given a chance by CNN’s Jake Tapper to call Trump out on a Twitter insult to Bush’s Mexican-born wife Columba. Bush started strong, demanding an apology, but then faded again as Trump filibustered.

But Bush’s worst moment was when Hewitt asked him – in another kindness to Trump – about the fact that a lot of his foreign policy advisors worked for his brother, the last GOP president, who got us into disastrous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Trump then jabbed Bush – “Your brother, and your brother’s administration, gave us Barack Obama” – which led Bush to retort, “My brother kept us safe.” As if he didn’t remember his brother was president during the Sept. 11 attacks. It was that kind of night for Jeb!

Trump didn’t have a great night either, but he has one thing in common with Reagan – so far he’s seemed to share an impermeable outer political coating with the Teflon president. He engaged in a juvenile spat with Rand Paul early on that ended in his insulting Paul’s looks, and looking kind of silly. Carly Fiorina absolutely owned him when she was asked about the episode when Trump clearly insulted her appearance —  ‘Look at that face!’ he told Rolling Stone. ‘Would anyone vote for that?” — then insisted he was actually talking about her “persona.”

“Women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said,” Fiorina shot back. “I think she’s got a beautiful face and I think she’s a beautiful woman,” Trump countered, with characteristic sexism, but looking uncharacteristically sheepish. This was an establishment crowd, heavy on donors, and they were tougher on Trump than the Fox audience was. Perhaps most damaging, Trump himself seemed relatively “low-energy” – his constant jibe against Bush. He told reporters later that it was his attempt at looking presidential, but whatever: he was much less a factor than in the last GOP go-round. Still, pundits have predicted Trump’s decline before, including after his boorish performance in the last debate, and they’ve been wrong. Trump himself crowed about a Drudge Report poll showing him the winner of the debate, again. That poll was right last time, so who knows. Once again, lots of the punditocracy claimed Sen. Marco Rubio was one of the debate winners, but that’s crazy. The young Florida senator fell flat on his face with an early joke about the California drought: “I brought my own water!” he said with a big dumb smile. That was a twofer: He made fun of a local tragedy on a day when the death toll of the state’s drought-fueled wildfires continued to mount, and he reminded everyone of his humiliating big-gulp moment when he got to reply to Obama’s State of the Union address two years ago. When Trump dinged Rubio – accurately — for having the worst absentee record in the Senate, Rubio essentially defended it by saying Congress isn’t getting anything done. So he stopped doing his job because it was frustrating? In the real world, he’d get fired. Score one for Trump. Anyway, lots of smart-ish folks thought Rubio did well in the last debate to0, but he went nowhere in the polls. Fiorina probably had the best night — if you don’t fact check anything she said. She flat out lied about what the doctored, bogus Planned Parenthood videos showed, claiming they featured a still living intact aborted fetus, killed for its organs, when they did no such thing. When she insisted she’d call Iran’s Supreme Leader to call off the recent nuclear deal on her first day as president, the CNN moderators missed a chance to ask her why, as CEO of Hewlett Packard, she skirted anti-Iran sanctions — rather like the night’s patron saint, Ronald Reagan — and sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment to the anti-U.S. regime. She was allowed to misrepresent her awful HP record, and inaccurately trash Hillary Clinton on Benghazi and her controversial email practices. Still, she’s a poised, practiced debater, and she may get another small bump in the polls. I don’t think any of the rest, including the occasionally statesmanlike John Kasich, did enough last night to significantly change their campaign standing. Gov. Scott Walker was a bit more energetic but probably didn’t make enough of an impression to reverse his sinking fortunes. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Mike Huckabee continued stridently narrow-casting to the far-right evangelical community, which might matter if Trump suddenly left the field. But the twice divorced libertine billionaire and born-again Republican is leading among that group, too. Whoops, I haven’t mentioned the pumped up, inauthentic “It’s not about me, guys” flailing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Oh well. Now I have. At any rate, the seemingly interminable three-hour debate – I accidentally typed “three-month debate,” because that’s how it felt – worked against anyone who had a good moment or two. Still, remember that most post-debate predictions were wrong last time. Once again, we learned that the GOP has moved far to the right of Ronald Reagan – but little else.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Of course he s a  racist  for defending legal American citizens Unlike Obama, Trump s not looking to make friends with illegal aliens. Legal American citizens will reward his dedication to defending our borders with their votes Donald Trump, business mogul and current Republican front-runner, has reiterated his stand on the issue of illegal immigration, saying that he would deport up to 11 million illegals and then build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.Trump has taken plenty of heat from Democrats and his Republican challengers, some of whom tried to get him to back down from his non-politically correct views. The Donald will have none of it.In nearly every recent public appearance, and in the second Republican debates on Sept. 16, Trump noted that the number of illegals is likely much higher than 11 million, and that he would deport the lot of them forthwith.Specifically, Mr. Trump said he could facilitate the mass deportation and rid the U.S. of nearly all illegal immigrants within two years, and possibly as fast as 18 months. Saying  We have to get them out,  and  We are a nation of laws,  Trump employed his typically colorful language when he concluded that he would deport the illegals so quickly,  Your head will spin. Trump s 2-year plan would deport, on average, 15,068.4 illegal immigrants per day in order to reach the 11 million mark successfully.Until now, one of the starting points in most debates about illegal immigration, especially among moderate Republicans and Democrats, has been the notion that there are so many undocumented immigrants in the U.S., it would be impossible to deport them all.Trump proposes a fast deportation plan followed by the building of a massive border wall to keep future illegal crossers from coming over. Further, the candidate s proposal includes a provision whereby those who are deported can apply to re-enter the U.S., but they must follow the formal, legal procedures already in place.The formal entry process is lengthy, involves a significant amount of paperwork, and is intended to keep criminals and unsavory characters (like potential terrorists) out of the country. In fact, most developed nations have more stringent immigration policies than the U.S. does. Mexico, for example, is quite strict about its own southern border, where many Central American immigrants attempt to sneak into the country without proper documentation. Typically those illegal entrants are caught, jailed, and then quickly deported.Trump s views are not lost on African Americans, many of whom responded to a recent SurveyUSA poll about their preferences in the upcoming general election. One-fourth of the respondents said they would choose Trump over Hillary Clinton if that were the matchup in November 2016. In most national elections, blacks vote for the Democrat candidate about nine-to-one over the Republican. Many blacks see illegal immigration as one of the reasons for the exceedingly high unemployment rate in their communities. Via: US World Report",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"One-third of precincts in Wayne County could be disqualified from an unprecedented statewide recount of presidential election results because of problems with ballots.Michigan s largest county voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, but officials couldn t reconcile vote totals for 610 of 1,680 precincts during a countywide canvass of vote results late last month.Most of those are in heavily Democratic Detroit, where the number of ballots in precinct poll books did not match those of voting machine printout reports in 59 percent of precincts, 392 of 662.According to state law, precincts whose poll books don t match with ballots can t be recounted. If that happens, original election results stand. It s not good,  conceded Daniel Baxter, elections director for the city of Detroit.He blamed the discrepancies on the city s decade-old voting machines, saying 87 optical scanners broke on Election Day. Many jammed when voters fed ballots into scanners, which can result in erroneous vote counts if ballots are inserted multiple times. Poll workers are supposed to adjust counters to reflect a single vote but in many cases failed to do so, causing the discrepancies, Baxter said.Even so, Baxter said it s unlikely all 392 of the city s precincts with mismatched numbers will be disqualified from a recount. The city is in contact with elections officials at the state of Michigan and Baxter predicted the numbers will match when the ballot boxes are re-opened for the recount, which starts Tuesday in Wayne County at Cobo Center. It s a challenge, but we re confident the ballots will match,  Baxter said.  I don t think it s going to be 100 percent, but it never is with a recount. County reports obtained by The Detroit News, though, indicate canvassers were provided no explanation for why the numbers didn t add up in those precincts. They certified the results of the election anyway.U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith ordered the hand recount of 4.8 million ballots just after midnight Monday, granting a motion in favor of Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. It began Monday in Oakland and Ingham counties and continues at 9 a.m. Tuesday in Kalamazoo, Kent, Macomb, Ottawa, Washtenaw and Wayne counties.The recount will begin throughout the rest of Michigan s 83 counties in phases this week.Republican President-elect Donald Trump won Michigan by a razor-thin margin, 10,704 votes. Presumably, Clinton s best opportunity to eliminate that margin rested in finding uncounted ballots in Wayne County, which she carried by a 2-1 ratio.Besides Wayne, Clinton carried Oakland, Washtenaw, Genesee, Ingham, Kalamazoo, Marquette and Muskegon counties.None had nearly as many problems as Wayne. But at least 13 of 222 precincts in Genesee County are not balanced. More than half of those were in heavily Democratic Flint, according to county canvassing reports. The election was still certified by its board of canvassers. The trouble is there s too much leniency with the board of canvassers,  said John Gleason, Genesee County s clerk.  They re not as stringent as need to be because they think it won t affect the outcome of the election. Gleason, who estimated the recount will cost the cash-strapped county $100,000, said he expects the numbers to reconcile when workers begin the county recount on Wednesday. It s impossible to tell at this point how many will and how many won t be re-countable,  added Joseph Rozell, elections director for Oakland County.In the first six hours of Ingham County s recount Monday, six of 30 precincts from Lansing could not be recounted. One of the ballot containers had a hole in it, making it susceptible to tampering and not recountable, county Clerk Barb Byrum said.Two tries to match numbersState law spells out a prescribed criteria for determining whether a precinct can be recounted. Workers first check to make sure the number of ballots on the seal of the container matches the ballots recorded by workers on Election Day. If the seal number matches, then we know it s not been tampered with,  Rozell said.If numbers don t match, then workers can count all of the ballots in the precinct twice to see if there was an error made by workers on Election Night. If it does not match after the second count, then it s not recountable,  Rozell said.Entire precincts can be set aside in a recount if the ballots are stored in an unapproved container or if it isn t properly sealed.At Ingham County s recount operation Monday at the county s fairgrounds in Mason, ballots were stored in suitcase-like containers that were sealed with plastic zip-ties that had to be cut for workers to take out the ballots.Byrum plans to have the ballot bags guarded each night during the recount by a sheriff s deputy.

However, a close look at the evidence shows Huffington Post to be wrong: Trump’s win was overwhelmingly driven by Americans’ repudiation of the aristocracy itself (such as, for example, repudiation of the Institute that runs Huffington Post’s neoconservative international edition, World Post , the Berggruen Institute (including Eric Schmidt , Lawrence Summers , Fareed Zakaria , Arianna Huffington, Nicholas Berggruen , Ernesto Zedillo , Carl Bildt, Niall Ferguson, and Joseph Nye , all being proponents of Obama’s building war against Russia — such as : “To confront Putin, Europe will have to make changes that will be deeply controversial on a continent long committed to environmentalism and marked by an aversion to the use of force”). And, as far as global warming is concerned, which is a real problem about Trump, it’s also very much and demonstrably — not merely in words — a real problem about Hillary too (and one that outside the context of the Presidential campaign has even been courageously reported by some of HuffPo’s own reporters ), but HuffPo and other Democratic Party propagandists pretend there’s reason to believe that Trump’s actions would be even worse than hers have been, and HuffPo’s readers thus end up being little else than Democratic Party suckers who feel satisfied in their ‘news’ reading to soak up what is almost entirely Democratic Party propaganda, which means the propaganda emanating out of the White House whenever a Democrat resides there — sort of like a Democratic Party version of the Republican Party’s Fox ‘News’. The aristocracy ( all of it, both its Republican and its Democratic Party branches) continue their campaign, and expect to crush their opposition — the public (of all parties). And that’s what a close look at the evidence shows explains Trump’s win — not bigotry on the part of the American public. Bigotry is a huge problem in every society, but especially amongst the aristocracy, who love to pretend that it’s mainly a problem ‘down below’ — so that they can continue to exploit the public while claiming to be superior to it.

One man was later released, though he could still face charges, authorities in the southern Spanish city said. In a statement, the Cecop centre that oversees security during the annual processions said those detained had “shouted” used metallic objects to make loud noise or made “wild gesticulations” to create panic in the   crowds. An AFP photographer present said she heard what sounded like a stampede of galloping animals, and then a mass of people pushed towards her. Standing on the Isabel II bridge that straddles Seville’s Guadalquivir River, she climbed onto a lamppost. “There were children, women with prams,” she said, adding that some people rushed down steps towards the river, falling over themselves in panic. “The first thing people think is that there is a terrorist attack. ” Spanish media reported that some of those later detained shouted “Allah is great” as well as slogans in favour of the Basque separatist group ETA. But Ricardo   the central government’s representative in Seville, said there was no link to extremism. “It’s got nothing to do with Islamist groups, ETA, or any known terrorist group,” he told reporters in comments broadcast on Spanish television. “They wanted to create the utmost panic with their shouting,” he added. An initial probe showed that there were three initial movements of panic, which sparked a “domino effect” in other parts of the city, Cecop said. “These are isolated cases without any apparent connection that are similar to cases of vandalism and hooliganism,” it said. The situation was later brought back under control and the processions continued. Cecop said three of those arrested were “common delinquents”. Some 17 people were taken to hospital for injuries and panic attacks, it said. One of them was in intensive care in a serious condition with a head injury. Organised by religious brotherhoods and featuring huge floats of wooden sculptures of religious scenes accompanied by hooded penitents, the processions known as “La Madruga” are the high point of Easter Week festivities in Seville. This morning’s early incident mirrors a similar outbreak of panic in 2000 in Seville’s Good Friday processions, which left 52 people injured. Good Friday is the second of four intensive days in the Christian calendar culminating in Easter Sunday, which commemorates Christ’s resurrection.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"  A Black Agenda Radio Commentary by Bruce A. Dixon 
When astute political commentary from a half century ago eloquently describes the current political conundrum it means we’ve been stuck in a bad place for a long time. Do we really want Malcolm’s observation to apply four or eight or twenty years further into the future? Malcolm X on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump A Black Agenda Radio Commentary by Bruce A. Dixon 
It’s that time again, it’s presidential election season, and as we hear every four years, THIS is the most important presidential election of our lives. The fact that you’ve heard that before should tell us something. It should us that in presidential years, many old things becomes new again, often because so much of what we’re told IS new is really pretty old. 
Malcolm X has been dead now a half century, dead for more years than he was ever alive. But since at least one of the tricks and traps deployed to fool, frustrate and neutralize our grandparents’ right to vote hasn’t changed much we might want to listen carefully to what Malcolm’s words in the aftermath of the 1964 presidential election. 
“ If Johnson had been running all by himself, he would not have been acceptable to anyone. The only thing that made him acceptable to the world was that the shrewd capitalists, the shrewd imperialists, knew that the only way people would run toward the fox would be if you showed them a wolf. So they created a ghastly alternative. And it had the whole world — including people who call themselves Marxists — hoping that Johnson would beat Goldwater.” 
Like today’s Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater was a truly reprehensible and frightening figure, who had opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned racial discrimination in public accommodations, and who favored the use of nuclear weapons to defoliate the Vietnamese countryside. Also like Donald Trump, Goldwater never really stood a chance of winning the election. Goldwater the wolf was buried beneath a Johnson landslide, carrying only 6 out of the 50 states. Republican officeholders are running away from Donald Trump not because he’s a racist bufoon but because he’s expected to lose states Republicans are accustomed to winning. 
The fox, Lyndon Baines Johnson went on to start a war in Indochina that killed three million Vietnamese alone. LBJ defoliated the Vietnamese countryside with millions of tons of Agent Orange instead of nukes, causing hundreds of thousands of hideous and gruesome birth defects that continue to this day. 
The wolf and the fox this year are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Trump is a real estate con man, a racist and a hyper-entitled sexual predator who talks about building walls and banning Muslims. Fortunately for us all, Trump has never been in government. Hillary has scarcely ever been out of government. She’s fronted for Wal-Mart, executed bloody regime change in Libya, brought US troops to Ukraine on the Russian border, and publicly itches for a showdown in Syria. Thanks to Wikileaks there is copious evidence that Hillary’s public stands on a wide range of issues from charter schools to so-called trade agreements, to fracking and social security stand in stark contrast to the promises she makes to the powerful. 
Just as it worked 52 years ago, the overwhelming defeat of her wolvish opponent will give Hillary the appearance of a mandate. But the margin of Hillary’s victory provides those of us on the left an unprecedented opportunity. It means there is no need for those who imagine themselves on the of jobs, justice, peace and the planet to ride to Hilllary’s rescue and ensure the defeat of Donald Trump. Trump has already beaten himself. 
This election is our best chance to break out of the decades-old two party trap and build a new political force, a new political party. The Green Party is the only peace party, the only party that stands for people and planet over profit, and our only opportunity to vote our hopes, not our fears. It’s time to choose. 
We vote Green and build Green, we can consign the political conundrum Malcolm X eloquently described a half century ago to the garbage can of history. Or we can vote for Hillary, and Malcolm’s words will be as applicable four or eight years or twenty years from now as they have been for the last fifty. For Black Agenda Radio I’m Bruce Dixon.

FBI Director Comey’s weekend decision not to pursue crooked Hillary for her mishandling of secret government emails was a startling acquiescence to the White House position: In a letter to Congress, Comey said that Clinton should not face criminal charges on the basis of newly discovered State Department emails on a non-secure device. 
One can imagine that the FBI Director was ferociously pressured to back down from his earlier accusations. And the switch created the desired headlines one day before the election that concerned voters could safely choose Hillary: she won’t be dragged from the Oval Office to be tried as a criminal! 
The Sacramento Bee had a nicely artistic presentation: 
The liberal press all headlined with the same not-so-subliminal message — Vote Democrat: 
FBI SAYS REVIEW CLEARS CLINTON IN EMAIL INQUIRY — New York Times 
FBI won’t pursue charges against Clinton — Washington Post 
FBI Affirms No Clinton Charges —Wall Street Journal 
FBI clears Clinton but Anger Persists — Los Angeles Times 
Clinton cleared in late twist — Chicago Tribune 
FBI clears Clinton in email case — Houston Chronicle 
Again, no FBI e-mail charge — Denver Post 
So five out of eight newspapers (chosen by me as being typical major publications) used the verb “clear” which is broad and has the air of finality. 
However, the truth is more complex than a brief headline can convey: Hillary may get a temporary reprieve on the email case now, but that doesn’t mean she is off the hook. As Congressman Trey Gowdy (a former prosecutor) remarked on Sunday, “Investigations are never over unless a statute of limitations has expired or unless jeopardy has attached.” 
So if something more incriminating turns up, it’s game on. 
Plus, the Clinton Foundation remains an object of FBI investigation and is rumored to be a stronger case. In fact, Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer appeared on a Fox Business show Monday and remarked, “The way it’s been explained to me by people in the FBI sphere is that basically they’re going to get one bite at this apple, so if you bring an email case prosecution, or were to do that and were to fail, the Clinton Foundation investigation just politically would be too much.” 
Certainly the Wikileaks story that Chelsea’s deluxe wedding was financed by the Foundation has refocused attention on family’s corrupt slush fund disguised as a do-gooder organization. 
So Hillary in prison orange remains a possibility, albeit an unlikely one.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Wow! Former Bears coach Mike Ditka is coming under fire from the liberal media and Black Lives Matter activists for saying there has been  no oppression in the last 100 years .Former Chicago Bears star and coach Mike Ditka, an adamant critic of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial discrimination, said Monday in a national radio interview that this country has been free of oppression for at least a century. All of a sudden, it s become a big deal now, about oppression,  Ditka told Jim Gray on Westwood One s pregame show ahead of the Bears   Monday Night Football  loss to the Vikings.  There has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of. Now maybe I m not watching it as carefully as other people. As a side note, the now unemployed and clearly  oppressed  49 ers QB, Colin Kaepernick who started kneeling to show his unity with the anti-cop, Black Lives Matter movement, listed his humble abode in San Jose, CA, 10 months ago, for a mere $2.9 million.According to Realtor.com, the gated four-bedroom, 5.5-bath estate features 4,500 square feet of living space on a 20,000-square-foot secluded lot with a long private driveway and expansive views of the valley.Ditka continued: Is that the stage for this? If you want to protest, or whatever you want to protest, you ve got a right to do that, but I think you re a professional athlete, you have an obligation to the game,  Ditka said.  I think you have to respect the game. That s what I think is the most important thing. I don t see a lot of respect for the game. I just see respect for their own individual opinions. Opinions are like noses, we all have one. Some are good. Some are bad. Ditka insisted he wasn t  condemning anybody or criticizing anybody  but urged players to  protest when the game s over, protest whatever other way you want to  and said he would bench players who insisted on demonstrating during the anthem because it s disrespectful. If you don t respect our country, then you shouldn t be in this country playing football,  he said.  Go to another country and play football. If you had to go somewhere else to try to play the sport, you wouldn t have a job. So that would be my take. If you can t respect the flag and the country, then you don t respect what this is all about. So I would say, adios. Gray cited athletes such as Muhammad Ali and Jesse Owens who have taken on social injustices, but Ditka was unmoved. I don t know what social injustices have been,  Ditka said.  Muhammad Ali rose to the top. Jesse Owens is one of the classiest individuals that ever lived. I mean, you can say,  Are you (saying) everything is based on color?  I don t see it that way. I think that you have to be color blind in this country. You ve got to look at a person for what he is and what he stands for and how he produces, not by the color of his skin. That has never had anything to do with anything. Ditka said there are opportunities for everyone in the United States, regardless of race, religion, creed, color, nationality  if you want to work, if you want to try, if you want to put effort into yourself. I think you can accomplish anything, and we have watched that throughout our history of our country. People rise to the top and they became very influential people in our country by doing the right things.   Trib LiveMost of America gets what Ditka is trying to say when he says there has been  no oppression for 100 years . He s clearly referring to the era of slavery. The idea, however, that Ditka would point out that slavery ended 100 years ago, and that we are, and have been, for decades, a nation of equal opportunity for all, was more than the left and the liberal media could bear.

Trump’s “America We Deserve” book came out on 1/15/2000. I’ve learned magnitudes of mind-changing information in 16 years. Maybe Trump has, too (though he obviously does still have some huge blind spots, such as believing whatever the “Nightly News” says about anything/everything, from mass shootings [not awake to false flags] to boogeymen terrorists/ISIS [not awake to the fact the CIA/Mossad/MI5/6 create/fund the terrorist groups] to believing the lie that we need to give up privacy for “more security” [his current anti-Apple vs. FBI opinion], etc.). Even so, I think Trump is “TEACHABLE,” if the right people are given his ear. 
Steve B. said: “…I cannot and will not vote for him, until that repudiation of his pro-choice past comes.” 
He has told the story quite a few times of his change of opinion re abortion. In short, he had friends who were going to abort but had the baby who then grew up to be a great kid which touched his heart personally. And in just the past few days I heard him say he basically went along with the abortion idea in his prior years because his daughter thought it was an OK thing, so he thought it was an OK thing, too. If Ivanka is nearing 35, then she probably DID think it was OK when she was 20-ish. (He did not say that in a blaming or scapegoating kind of way, btw.) Granted, Trump is obviously NOT a Biblically-discipled follower of Jesus. He may be a BELIEVER in Jesus, but he has obviously never been discipled. Trump needs an Aquila & Priscilla to “…take him unto them, and expound unto him the way of God more perfectly.” (Acts 18:26). 
Here’s Trump’s anti-abortion statement from two days ago at his FB site. (Of course, I disagree with him still re: exceptions for “rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk.” That’s still Lefty hogwash. No baby deserves to be murdered. The baby cannot determine the circumstances. Whatever happened to adoption, for pete’s sake?!): 
[…] Donald J. Trump February 16 at 4:11pm 
Let me be clear—I am pro-life. I support that position with exceptions allowed for rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk. I did not always hold this position, but I had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me. My story is well documented, so I will not retell it here. However, what I will do with the remaining space is express my feelings about life, and the culture of life, as we approach the 43nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade. 
I build things. There is a process involved in building things. We tap into a lot of disciplines with engineering being one of the most important. The rules for putting structures together are as strict as are the rules of physics. These rules have stood the test of time and have become the path to putting together structures that endure and are beautiful. America, when it is at its best, follows a set of rules that have worked since our founding. One of those rules is that we, as Americans, revere life and have done so since our Founders made it the first, and most important, of our “unalienable” rights. 
Over time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country. They never had the chance to become doctors, musicians, farmers, teachers, husbands, fathers, sons or daughters. They never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills, lives, loves or passions into the fabric of country. They are missing, and they are missed. 
The Supreme Court in 1973 based their decision on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found. Even if we take the court at its word, that abortion is a matter of privacy, we should then extend the argument to the logical conclusion that private funds, then, should subsidize this choice rather than the half billion dollars given to abortion providers every year by Congress. Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best. 
If using taxpayer money to facilitate our slide to a culture of death was not enough, the 1973 decision became a landmark decision demonstrating the utter contempt the court had for federalism and the 10th Amendment. Roe v. Wade gave the court an excuse to dismantle the decisions of state legislatures and the votes of the people. This is a pattern that the court has repeated over and over again since that decision. Perhaps Roe v. Wade became yet another incidence of disconnect between the people and their government. 
We are in the middle of a presidential political cycle and votes will be cast in just days. The citizens of this nation will have the chance to vote for candidates that are aligned with their individual worldviews. It is my hope that they will choose the builder, the man who has the ability to imagine the greatness of this nation. The next President must follow those principles that work best and that reinforce the reverence Americans hold for life. A culture of life is too important to let slip away for convenience or political correctness. It is by preserving our culture of life that we will Make America Great Again.

0,WELFake Dataset,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - The head of an Indonesian group representing victims of the mass killings of alleged communists in the mid-1960s said he had pinpointed 16 suspected mass grave sites in central Java that could contain about 5,000 bodies.     Bedjo Untung, of the 1965 Murder Victims Research Foundation (YPKP 65), said the sites were around the town of Purwodadi where suspected communists were sent for execution. Untung has asked the human rights commission (Komnas HAM) to investigate.    Some of the bodies were thrown into a ravine. Some were thrown in wells,  Untung told a new briefing, citing the testimony of three witnesses.   I have a witness who when he was a kid used to follow his father to wash the dead bodies. Every morning people sent them around 50 bodies. So we estimate there were around 5,000,  he said, adding that human bones had been found in the area.  I can conclude that they were suspected followers of the Indonesian communist party (PKI),  said Untung, who was himself jailed for being a member of the now banned PKI. One of the worst massacres of the 20th century, some historians say at least 500,000 people died in an orgy of bloodshed after then-general Suharto took power following an abortive coup. A million or more people were jailed, suspected of being communists. The killings in 1965 and 1966 have never been officially investigated and perpetrators have never faced justice despite a pledge by President Joko Widodo to resolve human rights issues. Untung said that 122 other suspected sites of mass graves had previously been identified.  According to newly declassified U.S. documents, the U.S. government had intimate knowledge of the mass killing of alleged communists even as it failed to publicly reveal the slaughter. The documents also reveal that Indonesian army intermediaries told Western embassies they were considering toppling then president Sukarno less than a fortnight after the killing of six generals by rebel military personnel that sparked the bloodletting. [L4N1MT2UD] Amiruddin Al Rahab, a commissioner at Komnas HAM, said he would look into the matter. The rights group has previously made recommendations to launch an official investigation and set up ad hoc human rights courts but so far these have not been enacted.  Indonesia, the world s largest Muslim-majority country, still has periodic bouts of anti-communist hysteria. In September, a meeting by human rights activists and YPKP 65 was shut down after Islamists and nationalists rioted outside the venue. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Life at migrant centers in Germany: RT talks to volunteers, refugees about their hopes & fears   20:39 Get short URL © Pascal Rossignol / Reuters Some have faced criticism in their own country for aiding asylum seekers, while others are themselves migrants who have seen their accommodation centers burnt down. RT Russian talked to residents and volunteers at migrant centers in Germany. 
Miriam Düsterhöft, 27, studies social science at university and believes that working at one of the refugee centers in Düsseldorf, Germany, will be a good experience. 
Düsterhöft told RT Russian that she wants to help refugees to integrate into Europe. Read more Christian refugees persecuted by Muslim asylum seekers in German shelters – survey 
“At first it was very difficult. There was a lack of essentials, it was hard to communicate with refugees. Many didn’t make any effort to learn German,” she said. 
One of the issues at the center was a lack of interpreters of Persian or Kurdish. There was a man who translated from Arabic for men, and a woman translating for female residents. 
“[Kurdish and Persian] women do not communicate with men, they are afraid to speak about certain things. Even we [volunteers] don’t know what they feel or need.” 
Asylum seekers have to spend at least six months at the center before authorities can grant them refugee status and provide them with accommodation. Sometimes they have to wait longer before receiving the status, or because the condition of the accommodation provided is much worse than that of the center, Düsterhöft said. 
Düsterhöft’s style of clothing at the center differs greatly from what she wears in her everyday life. Here at the migrant center she wears long skirts and trousers, and covers her hands with sleeves. 
“This is my decision – I have a lot of tattoos all over my body, and I don’t want to confuse people who aren’t accustoed to this. I don’t think that it infringes on my rights.” 
“No one has ever tried to rape me,” she added. This isn’t a random comment – asylum seekers have been accused of numerous sexual harassment incidents towards women and children in Europe since the start of 2016. 
Earlier in October, a female interpreter for a French journalist was raped near the notorious Calais ‘Jungle’ migrant camp. Reports also emerged that the woman’s attackers were three Pashto-speaking male asylum seekers. Read more 
Düsterhöft said she hasn’t had any major conflicts with refugees. The most serious incident was when the father of one child asked not to draw animals or humans during classes because Islam forbids the depiction of people. 
“We solved this issue and removed the controversial exercise,” she said. ‘There are bad people both among Europeans and migrants’ 
The mother of 18-year-old student Fiona Braun, who is giving German lessons to refugees, says that her life hasn’t changed with the arrival of asylum seekers. 
“My daughter works with refugee children from Syria and Afghanistan in camps in Vienna and in Bratislava,” Jana Olearnikova told RT Russian. 
“She [Fiona] now has a lot of female friends among migrants. Fiona comes home with new recipes that she learned from the Arab girls,” she said, adding that she welcomes “the opportunity to dive into Arab life” and likes “the diversity of cultures in Europe.” 
Olearnikova said she’s not afraid to walk alone in the evenings, despite the stories that have emerged since the refugee crisis started. 
“Of course, there may be criminals and bad people among migrants, but they may be among the Europeans, too,” she said. Syrian refugee: ‘ISIS killed my entire family, I have nowhere to go’ Read more More than 300,000 refugees in Germany work illegally, pay kickbacks to asylum center staff - reports 
Aid Abu Kasem was an architect back in Syria. He understands that when he receives refugee status, he won’t be able to find the same job in Germany. 
“But I don’t mind. The most important thing for me is to find myself in a new reality. I'm learning German, it’s very difficult, but I’m trying,” he told RT Russian.Kasem says it will be difficult for him to settle into his new home. 
“I know that in Germany there are common swimming pools and common saunas for men and women. They bathe together naked, although completely unfamiliar with each other. I can’t understand it. I guess I just won’t attend such places."" 
He said that the center in the town of Zirndorf, Bavaria, where he is currently living, was set on fire twice. 
“It’s unpleasant. I didn’t do evil to anyone and shouldn’t suffer for the fact that these people hate anyone who runs away from war.""

0,WELFake Dataset,"DHAKA, Bangladesh  —   More than 3, 000 people, some of them known Islamist militants, have been arrested in a series of police raids intended to quell a wave of deadly machete attacks against bloggers, minorities and others, the police said Saturday. The roundup began last week after militants killed the wife of a police superintendent who had been investigating the machete attacks. Over the course of the week, the police said, they killed five militants in shootouts. They were members of the Jama’atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh, one of two groups that the authorities believe are behind most of the attacks, the police said. Many citizens criticized the government for not taking action sooner against the militants, who have created a climate of terror since they began murdering secularist bloggers and others more than three years ago. Since 2013, bloggers, freethinkers, religious minorities, foreigners, gay activists, followers of more liberal strains of Islam and others have been killed in attacks carried out mostly by groups of young men wielding machetes. The government had previously arrested dozens of people involved in at least 40 such attacks, but until this past week had not carried out a nationwide crackdown. People close to the government said leaders were hesitant to clamp down for fear of alienating radical fundamentalists, who form a large voting bloc. “I welcome this special drive. It should have been taken much earlier,” said Shahriar Kabir, the general secretary of the South Asian People’s Union Against Fundamentalism and Communalism. The police believe Mr. Kabir was one of the militants’ top targets, and he leaves his house here only with police protection. But the leading opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, accused the government of using the crackdown as an excuse to round up opponents. “In the name of an antimilitant drive, the government is arresting opposition activists, including B. N. P. and other antigovernment people,” said Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, the party’s senior joint secretary general. A. K. M. Kamrul Ahsan, a Bangladeshi police spokesman, said that the crackdown began Friday at 6 a. m. and that within 24 hours more than 3, 000 suspects had been arrested nationwide. Five members of the Islamist group Jama’atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh were killed in shootouts with the police during the week, including one militant wanted in connection with the killing of a doctor last year and another who was suspected of shooting up a Shiite mosque during evening prayers last year, the police said. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, speaking at a meeting of her Awami League party committee on Saturday, vowed that the killers would be hunted down. Ms. Hasina also suggested that opposition parties had been involved in the killings of the bloggers and others. In addition to local groups, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for some of the killings on social media, and several attacks have been claimed by a faction of Al Qaeda on the Indian subcontinent.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"RALEIGH, N. C.  —   There is no doubt that officers surrounded him. That they shouted at him. That they shot him. But a crucial question about the fatal confrontation between Keith L. Scott and police officers in Charlotte, N. C. has always been whether Mr. Scott was wielding a gun. On Wednesday, in a   news conference that at times took on the feel of a courtroom argument, R. Andrew Murray, the district attorney for Mecklenburg County, laid out a case that Mr. Scott, who was black, had a gun in his hands and had not heeded warnings to drop it when he was shot and killed. “It’s a justified shooting based on the totality of the circumstances,” Mr. Murray said. No charges, he said, will be filed against the officer, Brentley Vinson, who is also black. Mr. Murray made his case with an elaborate presentation of videos, enhanced digital images and other evidence, a reflection of the increasing sophistication of prosecutors who must also sway a public skeptical of police accounts of fatal shootings. The Sept. 20 shooting of Mr. Scott was one of several deadly police interactions with   that have sparked waves of street demonstrations and an impassioned national conversation about race and the use of deadly force by police officers. Mr. Murray’s announcement came as a jury in Charleston, S. C. about a   drive southeast of Charlotte, was preparing to hear closing arguments in the case of Michael T. Slager, a former North Charleston police officer who was on duty when he shot and killed Walter L. Scott, a black man who was not related to Keith Scott, during a traffic stop and foot pursuit. In Charlotte, North Carolina’s largest city, the shooting of Keith Scott set off days of protest, some of it violent, and led to immense public pressure on the police to release dashboard and body camera recordings of the episode. Members of Mr. Scott’s family had claimed he had no gun at the time of the shooting, or they were unaware that he owned one. And when the recordings were released, they did not conclusively show whether Mr. Scott had a gun, as the police had asserted. But on Wednesday, Mr. Murray laid out the most detailed case yet that Mr. Scott, 43, was armed when officers confronted him while he was in his parked S. U. V. at his apartment complex in Charlotte’s University City neighborhood. Mr. Scott’s gun, a Colt . 380 semiautomatic, fell to the ground after he was shot, Mr. Murray said. It was later determined that the gun was cocked, with the safety off. Subsequent analysis found Mr. Scott’s DNA on the weapon. Mr. Murray said the authorities traced the gun and discovered that it had been stolen from a home and then illegally sold to Mr. Scott 18 days before the shooting. At the news conference, Mr. Murray exhibited a Facebook conversation he described as involving the gun’s seller and a third person, and said that the seller appeared to admit the transaction had occurred. The authorities, Mr. Murray said, also found records at a sporting goods store that suggested Mr. Scott had purchased a magazine and ammunition for a . 380 caliber handgun. Mr. Murray said some ammunition was found stuffed in a cigarette box in Mr. Scott’s vehicle. Mr. Murray also played a surveillance video that showed Mr. Scott outside a convenience store just before the shooting, with a bulge in his pants near the ankle. Mr. Murray said it was consistent with the officers’ assertion that Mr. Scott was wearing an ankle holster. In an investigative report released Wednesday, prosecutors noted that “every officer present reported seeing Scott holding a gun” after several of them surrounded his car. They had intended to investigate Mr. Scott after one officer saw him with a marijuana cigarette and a handgun. The videos of the episode show them yelling at Mr. Scott to drop the weapon. Mr. Murray said that Mr. Scott never raised the gun at officers. But in a letter to the State Bureau of Investigation and the Charlotte police, Mr. Murray said that an officer, like any other person, is “justified in using deadly force if he reasonably believed, and in fact believed, that he or another person was in imminent danger of great bodily injury or death. ” “Someone with a gun in his hand who does not comply with police commands to drop the gun can be reasonably considered to be an imminent deadly threat to officers,” Mr. Murray wrote, “and   studies show that a person can raise his gun and harm or kill officers before an officer could react to the threat. ” Mr. Scott’s family released a statement on Wednesday that thanked Mr. Murray and other officials for meeting with them, and explaining how they decided not to charge Officer Vinson, who was placed on administrative leave after the shooting. The family also said they were “profoundly disappointed” that Officer Vinson was not criminally charged. “All our family wanted was justice and for these members of law enforcement to understand that what they did was wrong,” the family statement said. Geoffrey Alpert, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, said on Wednesday that prosecutors most likely felt the available evidence would not earn a criminal conviction. “It’s a very high standard to indict a police officer for a criminal action in the line of duty,” he said. “But that has nothing to do with the righteousness or appropriateness of the shooting. ” A successful prosecution would be even more difficult, Dr. Alpert said, because the evidence indicated that Mr. Scott was armed, and that he did not comply with orders from the police to drop his weapon. But Dr. Alpert said he expected there would be a lawsuit, in which the legal standard is lower  —   a preponderance of evidence in civil actions versus evidence beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases. While the issue of criminality has been resolved, Dr. Alpert said questions remained. “Should they have called him out of the car? Should they have taken cover? What did they know about him at the time?” he said. “The question becomes: At what point does the officer feel threatened?” Susanna Birdsong, the policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina, said the decision not to bring charges pointed to the need for policies to ensure that officers “employ   tactics, avoid implicit bias and take into account how mental disabilities can affect a person’s behavior. ” Lawyers for Mr. Scott’s family held a separate news conference in Charlotte on Wednesday. They called for peace in the streets and said they hoped to eventually obtain justice for Mr. Scott. “We’re still in the process of investigating this case,” said Eduardo Curry, one of the lawyers. On Wednesday night, dozens of protesters gathered outside the   Police Department’s headquarters and marched to the center of the city. Three protesters were arrested on charges that they obstructed traffic, the police said on Twitter. Just after the shooting, several people in the apartment complex gave accounts that differed from the police officers’ version. In some cases, they shared their versions of events with the news media. Some of the witnesses said Mr. Scott was shot by a white officer. Some of them said Mr. Scott was reading a book at the time he was confronted. Mr. Murray said subsequent interviews showed that a number of these witnesses had not, in fact, seen the shooting. He also said there was no evidence of a book. Mr. Murray also noted that Mr. Scott’s wife, Rakeyia, had said that she was “certain” her husband did not have any guns after January 2016. “However, text messages between Mr. and Mrs. Scott the month before the shooting included an argument about a gun in Mr. Scott’s possession,” Mr. Murray said.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

Lorretta Lynch s DOJ would have already descended on them if the color of their skin was anything but black. We are witnessing something very ugly taking place in America, orchestrated by a man the majority of Americans voted for as their two-term president, because they actually believed he would make our country even better In rarely seen angle on the Black Lives Matter mob takeover of a NetRoots Nation Presidential Town Hall last weekend in Phoenix, Arizona, activists from the group scream explicit calls for violence and chaos, using an Occupy Wall Street style call-and-response technique to advocate  burn everything down,   shut this shit down,  and  rise the f*ck up. By the way, it s worth mentioning that spineless, pandering Democrat presidential candidate Martin O Malley was on the stage witnessing this whole scene unfold. Does anyone remember O Malley apologizing to the crowd following this event for having the audacity to say:  All lives matter ?The shouted manifesto lays bare the theory behind the burning, looting, and rioting that have transpired in recent months in Baltimore and Ferguson, and it also lays out the group s agenda on current news events like immigration reform, transgender activism, and the fables about the death of convicted criminal Sandra Bland that the group is spreading through the media.The nascent Black Lives Matter movement cannot claim that these statements were made by a few fringe members: the entire rant was orchestrated by Black Lives Matter Founder Patrisee Cullors, who can be seen in the video enthusiastically pumping her fist and shouting along with every incendiary statement.Nor is Black Lives Matter a fringe group; they have been embraced and given fealty by the highest levels of the Democratic power structure. Cullors told a British interviewer,  We re going into halls of power now. Many of us are meeting with mayors or meeting with local government. Some of us have met with President Obama himself to talk about the demands. Ms. Cullors  name appears on White House visitor records.Last week, Breitbart News exposed that convicted cop killer Assata Shakur is one of the heroes of the Black Lives Matter founders. Black Lives Matter pays homage to Cuban exile Shakur and quotes the Communist Manifesto at every single Black Lives Matter event.In one of the only cases of any coverage of the Black Lives Matter shrieks of angry poety at Netroots, CNN glossed over some of the crowd s chants in their reporting, but just as they did with Occupy movement, most of mainstream media has completely ignored the radical and revolutionary agenda revealed in Black Liver Matter s scripted call-and-response at NetRoots Nation. Even though the horde of screamers is surrounded by cameras, there has been no public criticism of Cullors and her folloers shouting  burn everything down,  nor any calls for her to apologize for her group s offensive statements.That media fail is unfortunate, because every American should hear who Black Lives Matter is, what they stand for and what they want, in the group s own words.Guided Transcript of What Black Lives Matter Said The group starts by pointing out that both leftist journalists like CNN s openly gay Don Lemon and mainstream racer baiting Democrats like the Reverend Al Sharpton and Rev. Jesse Jackson are actually too moderate for them:If I die in police custody do not let my parents talk to Don Lemon, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson or any of the motherfuckers that would destroy my name. Let them know that my sisters got this.Then another activist links the group with the LGBTQ political left. Black Lives Matter was founded by Cullors and two other women who self-identify as queer.The speaker makes reference to being called by  the name I choose, not the name I was given ; a familiar demand for anyone who has followed the recent Bruce  Caitlyn  Jenner controversy.If I die in police custody say my name, say my name  the name that I chose, not the one I was given. If I die in police custody make sure that I m remembered. Make sure my sisters are remembered. Say their names. Say their names. Marsha P. Johnson. [Unintelligible] Say their names! Say that Black Lives Matter! Black Lives Matter!https://youtu.be/raK8kI7oKW0Marsha P. Johnson is name used by Malcolm Michaels, Jr., a New York drag queen who died in 1992 in a death ruled a suicide. Johnson / Michaels was not in police custody.The group then turns to its pro-illegal immigration position. Two of Black Lives Matter s founders head up pro-Illegal alien groups.If I die in ICE custody say I am not a criminal. Stop funding prisons and detention centers! Shut ICE down and (unintelligible) jails and our prisons! Not one more deportation!The line about ending all deportations got huge applause and cheers from the Netroots.The group then begins to turn their screeched narrative into an emotional and paranoid attack on white people. In strident language, they shout their fear that  white supremacy  wants to kill black Americans en masse.If I die in police custody, know your silence helped kill me. White sumprecacy helped kill me. And my child is parentless now.If I die in police custody know that I want to live! We want to live! We fight to live! Black lives matter! All black lives matter!Then the mob makes a thinly veiled reference to Sandra Bland, a woman whose death the group has been exploiting and spreading false information and conspiracy theories about for several weeks.Bland s death in jail after she was arrested for assaulting a police officer was ruled a suicide, and an autopsy confirmed that suicide finding with physical evidence. The autopsy also revealed that Bland had a large amount of marijuana in her system.Additionally, Bland had made a previous suicide attempt, had spoken about depression in a video she d posted on social and during intake at the jail had written herself that she was  very depressed  that day. Further, Bland had had at least ten prior run-ins with law enforcement that had resulted in numerous conviction and over $7,500 in outstanding fines.Despite the mountain of evidence about Sandra Bland s sad history, the Black Lives Matter movement has continued to push the idea that Bland was an activist who was the victim of murder by the police. They push this narrative at Netroots with a series of calls to violent action:If I die in police custody don t believe the hype, I was murdered! Protect my family! Indict the system! Shut that shit down!If I die in police custody. Avenge my death! By any means necessary!If I die in police custody burn everything down! Because no building is worth more than my life! And that s the only way motherfuckers like you listen!If I die in police custody make sure I m the last person to die in police custody by any means necessary!If I die in police custody do not hold a moment of silence for me! Rise the fuck up! Because your silence is killing us!At this point, the group is interrupted by Netroots Nation official.As National Journal reported in a story that mentions none of these calls to violent action Netroots Nation itself announced plans to work with Black Lives Matter.For its part, Netroots declined to criticize the protest.  Although we wish the candidates had more time to respond to the issues, what happened today is reflective of an urgent moment that America is facing today,  the group said in a statement.  In 2016, we re heading to St. Louis. We plan to work with activists there just as we did in Phoenix with local leaders, including the #BlackLivesMatter movement, to amplify issues like racial profiling and police brutality in a major way.

0,WELFake Dataset,"The American Museum of Natural History has long been on the front lines of the climate change discussion, as its scientists study the potential damage and its educators try to alert new generations to the dangers of global warming. The depth of that mission is evident in the numerous exhibitions at this Manhattan museum, like the film “Wonders of the Arctic,” which is on view through March 2. “The polar bear has always been the symbol of the Arctic,” the narrator intones. “Now it’s become the face of climate change and the threat it poses. ” But one of the museum’s leaders, a trustee who is also an important donor to the institution, Rebekah Mercer, has been using her family’s millions to fund organizations that question climate change, a cornerstone of the conservative agenda she is advancing as an influential member of   Donald J. Trump’s transition team. In recent years the Mercer Family Foundation  —   which Ms. Mercer operates with her father, the New York investor Robert Mercer  —   has given nearly $8 million to organizations including the Heartland Institute in Illinois, a group that rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. She is also on the board of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that is skeptical of whether human behavior causes climate change. The connection of Ms. Mercer, the museum and the Mercer Family Foundation’s donation history came to light during an analysis by The New York Times of activities by cultural leaders who donated to Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. Several of them are board members at New York City arts organizations, including John Paulson at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Mercedes T. Bass at the Metropolitan Opera. But none are as unusual a fit as Ms. Mercer and the American Museum of Natural History. On one level, she is the sort of trustee museums and other nonprofit arts groups compete for: a   donor whose board membership could lead to more contributions. Museums regularly ask major donors to become trustees  —   particularly those as generous as Ms. Mercer, whose foundation has donated at least $3 million to the museum over the past few years. Museum leaders generally do not vet donors and trustees for their personal or political views or apply ideological litmus tests. But more often than not, trustees champion the missions and philosophical underpinnings of their museums. Since Ms. Mercer has only recently emerged as a   player in the Republican Party, bringing her charitable giving new public attention, it’s likely that the museum’s trustees were unaware of her philanthropic history  —   and specifically, her generous funding of organizations on the forefront of climate change skepticism  —   when she joined the board in 2013. About a dozen other trustees at the American Museum of Natural History contacted for comment declined or did not respond. Moreover, institutions with boards as large as the museum’s (which numbers 49) are typically run by a core group of highly active trustees, with others often being less knowledgeable about the detailed backgrounds of fellow members. It is unclear what, if any, influence Ms. Mercer has had at the museum beyond her financial leverage and her power as a board member. Ms. Mercer did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and Ellen V. Futter, the museum’s president, declined to comment about Ms. Mercer. But Ms. Futter was emphatic that it is the museum’s scientists, not its trustees, who make decisions about the substance of what is presented at the museum. “The scientists at the museum are the ones who are responsible for the interpretation and presentation of scientific content,” she said. “We’ve done several exhibits on climate change, we’ve done numerous education offerings on climate change,” she added, “and it is the scientists who make all of the decisions about science. ” Ms. Futter would not comment on the calls for Ms. Mercer to step down or what brought her to the board, declining to discuss the activities of a specific trustee. Told of Ms. Mercer’s role on the museum board, several scientists and environmental organizations said that she should resign or be removed from her position because, they said, she was working at cross purposes with its mission. “There is no room for promoters of   on the board of a science museum, let alone arguably the greatest science museum in the world,” said Michael E. Mann, a leader in the climate field who directs the Earth System Science Center at Penn State. He added that Ms. Mercer “has actively funded the climate change denial and disinformation campaign. ” The climate change positions of people surrounding Mr. Trump are being closely scrutinized as he takes office, partly because the   has described climate change as a hoax, and vowed to “cancel” the Paris climate accord and to undo President Obama’s Clean Power Plan. During the campaign, Ms. Mercer was one of Mr. Trump’s biggest donors, eventually joining his   transition team, in which she played a significant part in pushing forward one climate change skeptic for the cabinet: Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney general. “She’s certainly a force,” the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a top Trump adviser, said. “She’s one of the people whose phone calls get taken. ” Environmental concerns prompted climate scientists and other groups last year to call for removal of the conservative philanthropist David H. Koch from the museum’s board. He stepped down, though the museum said the reasons were unrelated to the protests. Ms. Mercer is not known for publicly speaking out on the climate change issue. But her generous support of organizations that raise doubts about global warming drew criticism from environmental groups like the Sierra Club and Greenpeace. “To politicize science is shameful to politicize the institutions that are designed to foster greater learning is even worse,” Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said. The museum’s executives “should acknowledge that they have a healthy endowment  —   a steady stream of funding  —   and they should thank Ms. Mercer for her service and talk about a reasonable plan for her to resign,” he said. Jesse Coleman, a researcher with Greenpeace, called Ms. Mercer’s role on the board troubling. “They’re an educational institution and they are trying to present the truth,” he said, “and now they have people in important positions on their board who are actively funding misinformation and they know that. ” In addition to the Heartland Institute and the Heritage Foundation, the Mercer foundation has made significant donations to the Cato Institute and the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, both of which also challenge aspects of climate change. The Oregon Institute, which does research on biochemistry and diagnostic medicine, was   by Arthur B. Robinson, a chemistry professor who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in Oregon and received $15, 000 in campaign contributions from Ms Mercer. In 1997, Mr. Robinson was   of an   piece in The Wall Street Journal, “Global Warming Is a Myth,” which called rising levels of carbon dioxide “a boon for the environment. ” The article was a rebuttal to the Kyoto Protocol, which embraced the existence of   global warming and set goals for worldwide emissions reductions. “There is not a shred of persuasive evidence that humans have been responsible for increasing global temperatures,” the piece said, adding, “So we needn’t worry about human use of hydrocarbons warming the Earth. ” Mr. Robinson also directed the Oregon Institute’s Petition Project, which said “that the   global warming hypothesis is without scientific validity and that government action on the basis of this hypothesis would unnecessarily and counterproductively damage both human prosperity and the natural environment. ” Ms. Mercer has science bona fides, having earned a master’s degree in management science and engineering from Stanford University, where she studied biology and math as an undergraduate. Her father worked for IBM before joining the successful hedge fund, Renaissance Technologies, where he became a chief executive in 2010. Though she briefly worked on Wall Street, Ms. Mercer  —   along with her sisters, Jenji and Heather Sue (their mother is Diana)  —   in 2006 purchased the Manhattan bakery Ruby et Violette, which now operates online. During the recent presidential campaign, Ms. Mercer started as a leading supporter of Ted Cruz, who also argued that the threat of global warming was overstated. She and her husband, Sylvain Mirochnikoff, a managing director at Morgan Stanley  —   they have four children  —   hosted a   for Mr. Cruz in 2015 at their Upper West Side triplex in Heritage at Trump Place. Among the biggest Mercer beneficiaries is the Heartland Institute, to which their foundation has given nearly $5 million. In 2011, Joseph Bast, president and chief executive of the institute, wrote that liberals accept global warming as true because stopping it “requires higher taxes, more income redistribution” and other “policies already on the liberal political agenda. ” “Liberals have no reason to ‘look under the hood’ of the global warming scare, to see what the real science says,” he added. “They believe in global warming because they feel it justifies their ideological convictions. ” Beka Economopoulos is founding director of a mobile project called the Natural History Museum, which in 2015 drafted a letter signed by scientists calling for institutions of science and natural history to “cut all ties” with fossil fuel companies. She said she found it troubling that Ms. Mercer held a governing role at the museum despite her support for groups that oppose its efforts. “How can a science museum reconcile placing a climate denier in a leadership position?” she said. “It’s incomprehensible. ” “In the   era,” Ms. Economopoulos added, “the role of our most trusted institutions of science is more important than ever. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON  —   Whenever a major conservative plan in Washington has collapsed, blame has usually been fairly easy to pin on the Republican   who insist on purity over practicality. But as Republicans sifted through the detritus of their failed effort to replace the Affordable Care Act, they were finding fault almost everywhere they looked. President Trump, posting on Twitter on Sunday, saw multiple culprits, including the renegade group of   conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus and outside groups like the Club for Growth. Those groups, which do not always work placidly together, had aligned against the president and Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the ultimate symbol of their dismay with the entrenched ways of the capital. At the same time, some saw the president as pointing a finger at Mr. Ryan when Mr. Trump urged his Twitter followers on Saturday to tune in to a Fox News host, Jeanine Pirro, who went on to call for Mr. Ryan’s resignation. For eight years, those divisions were often masked by Republicans’ shared antipathy toward President Barack Obama. Now, as the party struggles to adjust to the   political order, it is facing a nagging question: How do you hold together when the man who unified you in opposition is no longer around? Mr. Obama provided conservatives with not just a health law to loathe and a veto pen to blame, but also a visage that allowed their opposition to be more palpable. “With Obama no longer being there, the emotional element of the opposition is drained away,” said Rich Lowry, the editor of the conservative National Review. Republicans also have to contend with an outsider president who never had much of an affinity or loyalty for their party, and who, as a novice politician, has not built the relationships in Washington that are usually needed to get big deals done. “There’s this disjunction,” Mr. Lowry added. “He doesn’t have a congressional party. He doesn’t even really have a wing of a congressional party. ” In the health care fight, it was not just the far right, egged on by   outside groups, that split from the Republican leadership. There were dissenters among the more     conservative lawmakers, those representing suburban communities outside Philadelphia and Washington and rural states like Louisiana. Even party leaders like Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, the powerful chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, opposed the bill. Interest groups on the right were also divided, with natural allies like Americans for Tax Reform, the   outfit, and Americans for Prosperity, a   group backed by the Koch brothers, on opposing sides. While Republicans often said they would deliver freedom and good fortune if given their turn at the wheel, they are now jolted by the realization that their struggles to reach a consensus have thrown into doubt whether they can reach deals on other priorities like a tax overhaul, infrastructure, trade and immigration. “It is a challenge for the modern Republican Party and the Trump administration to figure out how to get to 218 on a regular basis,” said Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, who supported the Republican health care bill that failed last week. Generally, 218 is the number of votes needed to pass legislation in the House. Mr. Norquist said the desire for sweeping change had distorted some conservatives’ perceptions about what could be achieved and how quickly. “They want to change the rules,” he added. “But until you actually change the rules, they’re there, and you have to live by them. ” In a sign of just how deeply this episode has shaken the conservative faction of the party, one of the Freedom Caucus’s members resigned in protest on Sunday, saying he no longer believed the group was effective. “Saying no is easy, leading is hard, but that is what we were elected to do,” said the lawmaker, Representative Ted Poe of Texas. What makes progress on any issue so complicated is the fundamental clash between the belief systems of Mr. Trump, whose instincts are more populist than conservative, and Republican leaders in Congress, who are more oriented toward a     policy vision. “Trump, whatever else he is, was able to see that what was being offered to Republicans was not really what they wanted,” said David Frum, the conservative writer and a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush. “They wanted more health care for themselves, less immigration and no more Bushes. And what they were offered was no more health care, more immigration and a third Bush. ” The Trump administration wants to focus next on a tax overhaul. And on that Mr. Trump will probably find agreement with the Republicans in Congress. But crafting a plan that pleases most conservatives will not be simple. They remain split on some crucial details, like taxing imports. Some in the party, like Mr. Ryan, have favored such a plan, while others, like the   political advocacy groups, argue that it could set off trade wars and drive up manufacturing costs. Speaking to the dismay among many on the right after the health care fight, Ann Coulter, the writer and pundit, attacked Mr. Ryan for pursuing “standard G. O. P. corporatist stuff. ” “What made Donald Trump stand apart from the crowd, and apart from the crowd from every presidential candidate for 20 years,” she said on Fox’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” “was immigration, trade, infrastructure, building a wall. Obviously, that was very, very popular. ” As for Mr. Trump’s Twitter post on Saturday, a White House official said that it and Ms. Pirro’s attack on Mr. Ryan were a coincidence, but the president has been pressed by some advisers to consider Mr. Ryan’s role in the health care defeat. How Republicans resolve issues of debt and deficit spending also loom as tripwires to the kind of legislative progress Mr. Trump craves  —   especially after a rocky start to his presidency. These issues, which Mr. Ryan and many other Republicans have been waiting eagerly to tackle since they took power, are not especially important to Mr. Trump, who is more focused on the kinds of projects that are natural to him as a developer, like infrastructure. And esoteric debates over deficit spending will not matter nearly as much to voters as how their personal finances look. “When he goes back to Rochester in a   campaign, he can’t talk about what’s changed in the deficit  —   no one will care,” said Frank Cannon, a longtime conservative activist. “But if he can talk about labor rate participation, jobs, jobs that are paying more, that’s what he’ll be judged on. And that’s what Republicans are going to live and die by in the next election cycles as long as he’s president of the United States. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

CNN’s Brian Stelter calls Donald Trump a “uniquely fact-challenged candidate,” which is a prelude to introducing Daniel Dale, Washington correspondent for the Toronto Star , who fact checks every single word Trump utters and tallies them up for his paper . 
Dale says most fact-checkers look at two or three things Trump says, “meticulously fact-checks them and posts an article,” but “that doesn’t work when you have a candidate who is frequently saying 20 false things in a day, up to 37 on some days.”

— Reliable Sources (@ReliableSources) October 30, 2016 
The mainstream media likes to play the false equivalence game but there is no equivalence between Trump and Clinton. As Dale told Stelter, “There is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty.” Trump, says Dale, “is not a normal political liar.” 
For example, look at the presidential debates , in which Dale found 104 Trump false statements as opposed to 13 by Clinton. 
Dale’s judgment is that “there is no comparison in her level of accuracy with her opponent.” 
Trump also lies “pointlessly,” argues Dale, explaining to Brian Stelter that, 
“He gets things wrong where there is no political advantage to be gained and in those cases, it is not clear whether he’s lying or confused or unwilling to take the time to learn the facts.” 
This was Mark Cuban’s complaint, of course, that Trump has no interest in learning. 
In the end, it matters less why Trump lies than that he does, especially since he is busily convincing his base that Hillary Clinton is the dishonest candidate. And it is working. This is a trope frequently repeated by Trump’s supporters. You can correct them as often as you want; it will have no effect. 
The lie has taken hold – one of many – many more than you likely expected, and observational bias takes care of the rest. The Trump base is effectively lost to our shared reality, and as Dale tweeted last night, 
“If Trump loses, the Smart Republican Excavation is going to have to involve some long, hard base re-education.” 
Given the GOP’s history with facts, good luck with that.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress on Thursday averted a government shutdown just one day before federal funding was due to expire, sending President Donald Trump a bill to provide just enough money to keep agencies operating through Jan. 19. With lawmakers eager to begin a holiday recess until Jan. 3, the House of Representatives and Senate scurried to pass the hastily written bill by votes of 231-188 and 66-32, respectively. When Congress returns, lawmakers will immediately have to get back to work on appropriating more money for a fiscal year that already will be three months old. They will try to pass an “omnibus” spending bill to fund the government from Jan. 19 through Sept. 30. Negotiators have been struggling for months over thorny issues such as the amount of defense-spending increases versus increases for other domestic programs, including medical research, opioid treatment and “anti-terrorism” activities. Fiscal hawks, meanwhile, are angry that Congress is again moving to bust through spending caps that had been designed to tamp down mounting federal debt. But some of those same lawmakers in the Republican-controlled Congress earlier in the week voted for a sweeping tax bill that will add $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to a national debt that already stands at $20 trillion. With the clock ticking toward a deadline of midnight on Friday when government funding would run out, Democrats in the House and Senate made a strong pitch for including protections for young immigrants who entered the country illegally as children, popularly known as “Dreamers.” In the end, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and immigration advocacy groups failed. But nearly all of the House’s 193 Democrats and 29 of the Senate’s 46 Democrats voted no, in part to protest the lack of action on the immigration measure. Shortly before the House and Senate votes, Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez told reporters, “We’re really tired of tomorrow,” referring to years of failed attempts in Congress to protect Dreamers from deportation, allow them to legally work in the United States and get on a path to citizenship. They will resume their fight in January, aiming to win on the next spending bill or a separate measure. Trump has eliminated Obama-era temporary protections for Dreamers, but has asked Congress to come up with a permanent solution by March. In the meantime, about 122 Dreamers a day are becoming vulnerable to deportation while Congress bickers. Also on Thursday, the Senate put the brakes on another bill that passed the House, which would provide $81 billion in new disaster aid to help Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and several states hit by this year’s hurricanes or wildfires. The temporary spending bill did, however, give Trump a modest increase of $4.7 billion for the Department of Defense to be used for missile defense and ship repair. The bill includes $2.85 billion to fund the Children’s Health Insurance Program through March and funding for community health centers and the Indian Health Service. The plan also would extend the National Security Agency’s expiring internet surveillance program, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, through Jan. 19. Other provisions address funding for veterans, the Coast Guard and flood insurance. Most government programs would be temporarily extended until Jan. 19 at fiscal 2017 levels.

0,WELFake Dataset,"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   A pair of coordinated Taliban bombings targeted the Afghan Defense Ministry in a crowded neighborhood of Kabul on Monday, officials said, killing at least 24 people and wounding dozens, among them senior security officials. Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said an army general and a police colonel in charge of the area’s security were among the dead. Other officials said the deputy director of President Ashraf Ghani’s elite protection force had also been killed. At least 50 people were wounded, Mr. Sediqqi said. A spokesman for the Health Ministry put that number at 91. Hours later, just before midnight, a third explosion shook much of the city. Witnesses said that a car bomb had exploded outside a guesthouse near Kabul Bank, in the downtown   Naw neighborhood, and that gunmen had then tried to enter the house. Police special forces rushed to the scene, and sporadic gunfire could be heard. The Defense Ministry is near a crowded bazaar along the Kabul River, and the earlier explosions happened just as official hours were ending and government employees were heading home. The presidential palace and several other government agencies are also in the area. Mohammad Radmanish, a Defense Ministry spokesman, said both blasts had been suicide bombings. The first bomber detonated his explosives by a bridge outside the entrance to the ministry around 3:30 p. m. “When people and security forces arrived for help, the second attacker blew himself up among the crowd,” Mr. Radmanish said. Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said in a statement to the news media that his group was responsible for the explosions. The Taliban’s statement said that the first blast had been caused by placed explosives and that the second one had been a suicide bombing. The bombings were the latest in a   wave of attacks on government or Western targets in the capital, including a complex attack by gunmen with suicide vests on the American University that killed 13 people a week and a half ago. But the explosions on Monday had many in Kabul particularly worried. The loss of senior security personnel suggested that the Taliban had studied the Afghan forces’ response to their assaults. After most attacks in Kabul and the provinces, senior officials  —   sometimes even ministers  —   rush to the scene. The Taliban’s repeated assaults on   targets at the heart of the capital have added to the pressure on the already burdened security forces. The insurgency is not their only worry in the chaotic city: They have been stretched not only by regular crime, but also by street protests as well as by skirmishes between rival political groups. Even as blood from the first two bombings was being washed away on Monday, bodyguards for rival strongmen got into a shootout in a different corner of the city. Before the police reached the scene and cordoned off the area, one person was killed and three were wounded.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. government experts think North Korea could conduct a new missile test within days, in what would be its first launch since it fired a missile over Japan in mid-September, two  authoritative U.S. government sources said on Tuesday. One of the sources, who did not want to be identified, said the United States had evidence that Japanese reports about the monitoring of signals suggesting North Korea was preparing a new missile test were accurate.  Both sources said U.S. government experts believed a new test could occur  within days.  A Japanese government source said earlier on Tuesday that Japan had detected radio signals suggesting North Korea may be preparing another ballistic missile launch, although such signals were not unusual and satellite images did not show fresh activity. South Korea s Yonhap news agency, citing a South Korean government source, also reported that intelligence officials of the United States, South Korea and Japan had recently detected signs of a possible missile launch and have been on higher alert. The U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters declined to say what type of missile they think North Korea might test, but noted that Pyongyang had been working to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States and had already tested inter-continental ballistic missiles. Other U.S. intelligence officials have noted that North Korea has previously sent deliberately misleading signs of preparations for missile and nuclear tests. These have been in part to mask real preparations, and in part to test U.S. and allied intelligence on its activities. After firing missiles at a rate of about two or three a month since April, North Korea paused its missile launches in late September, after it fired a missile that passed over Japan s northern Hokkaido island on Sept. 15. Last week, North Korea denounced U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to relist it as a state sponsor of terrorism, calling it a  serious provocation and violent infringement.  The designation allows the United States to impose more sanctions, though some experts said it risked inflaming tensions. Trump has traded insults and threats with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and warned in his maiden speech to the United Nations in September that the United States would have no choice but to  totally destroy  North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies. Washington has said repeatedly that all options are on the table in dealing with North Korea, including military ones, but that it prefers a peaceful solution by Pyongyang agreeing to give up its nuclear and missile programs. To this end, Trump has pursued a policy of encouraging countries around the world, including North Korea s main ally and neighbor, China, to step up sanctions on Pyongyang to persuade it to give up its weapons programs.  North Korea has given no indication it is willing to re-enter dialogue on those terms. South Korean Unification Minister Chow Myoung-gyon told reporters on Tuesday there had been  noteworthy  movements from the North since its last missile launch, including engine tests, but there was no hard evidence of another nuclear or missile test.  North Korea hasn t been engaging in new nuclear or missile tests but recently we ve seen them persistently testing engines and carrying out fuel tests,  he said.  But we need some more time to see whether these are directly related to missile and nuclear tests.  Cho said North Korea may announce the completion of its nuclear program within a year, as it is moving more quickly than expected in developing its arsenal. North Korea defends its weapons programs as a necessary defense against U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Chinese spies steal from USA $100 billion a year 31.10.2016 Print version Font Size The Chinese intelligence has challenged the US national security system. China recruits senior military officials and conducts cyber attacks against the United States. What is worse, the Chinese intelligence has stolen Pentagon's plans for the future conflict with China, a recent report to US Congress said. The annual report from the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission has sounded the alarm with regard to the activities of Chinese security forces. The report said that despite extensive ties between Beijing and Washington, the US-China relations have remained tense during the current year, the Washington Free Beacon said. The relations between China and the United States have worsened primarily because of China's territorial claims in the South China Sea, permission from the United States to sell weapons to Taiwan, the deployment of the missile defense system in South Korea, Chinese cyber attacks and the US-led policy to ""restore balance"" in Asia.As for most serious threats, the report highlights cybercrime and the ""involvement of the human factor"" to gain access to objects of national security. The activities of the Chinese intelligence have increased significantly over the past 15 years. The work is carried out through the Ministry of State Security, the People's Liberation Army of China and military departments of the Communist Party, the report said. As for the ""human factor"", the report refers to the story of the recruitment of US Pacific Command Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Pierce Bishop. The man was in an intimate relationship with a Chinese woman, who eventually recruited him. Thus, the information about US military secrets in the field of nuclear weapons, secrets of the Reaper MQ-9 UAV and the secret US report about the Strategy of the Ministry of Defense of China was compromised. The report also mentions a few other recruited gentlemen: another senior official of the Pacific Command - James Fondren, who delivered ""The National Defense Strategy of the USA"" to China in 2010. Another man, Greg Bergerssen, delivered state secrets to China before he was arrested in 2008. US naval officer Edward Lin was caught for selling secrets of the US Navy to China. All this information may undermine the military superiority of the United States by promoting China's military modernization and providing China with understanding of the tactics of military operations and other operational approaches of the United States to potential developments in the region, the report said. Noteworthy, China spies even on members of government delegations. For example, British officials, before going to the G20 summit in Hangzhou, were instructed to avoid contacts with ""Chinese spies who offer sex"", The Irish Times said. The officials were instructed not to take any gifts, especially electronic devices containing memory cards, SIM-cards or chargers as they could serve as a basis for video and audio surveillance. All the members of the British delegation were given temporary mobile phones and e-mail addresses. The officials were even recommended to change their clothes under blankets to avoid any chance of taking their nude pictures. ""Chinese intelligence has repeatedly infiltrated U.S. national security entities and extracted information with serious consequences for U.S. national security, including information on the plans and operations of U.S. military forces and the designs of U.S. weapons and weapons systems,"" the report said. ""Among the information extracted were 5.6 million fingerprints, some of which could be used to identify undercover U.S. government agents or to create duplicates of biometric data to obtain access to classified areas,"" it continued. China uses a variety of ""actors"" for its cyber espionage - from ""government contractor"" to independent ""patriotic hackers"" and ""criminal entities."" These groups often interact with each other. The US Department of Justice paid attention to the arrest of US citizen Allen Ho, who was accused of stealing nuclear technology for China General Group. Ho enlisted as many as six American engineers for the purpose. In addition, the DoJ and the FBI accused Chinese nationals of the theft of know-how technology for the production of carbon fiber for submarines and compounds for bleaching materials.The FBI evaluated losses from industrial espionage at 19 billion dollars a year. In one outstanding incidence, former Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez had his laptop hacked into and copied in Beijing, even though Gutierrez was one of the key figures in international trade negotiations. The information from his laptop was subsequently used to break into US government computers.James Andrew Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said that the stolen intellectual property of the USA brings China the profit of up to 100 billion a year. Interestingly, only a few Chinese spies have been arrested so far, John R. Schindler wrote for The Observer. The potential of the Chinese intelligence is high: 300,000 Chinese students studying in American universities.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON — FBI Director James Comey said Friday that investigators had found new emails related to the bureau's previously closed inquiry into Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information, restarting a long-simmering debate over the Democratic nominee's conduct as secretary of State in the closing days of a presidential campaign that Clinton appeared to be putting away.

In a letter to senior lawmakers explaining his decision, Comey said ""the FBI cannot yet assess"" whether the information is ""significant"" nor could he offer a timetable for how long it will take investigators to make an assessment.

But an official familiar with the matter said Friday that the new materials, perhaps thousands of emails, were discovered in the ongoing and separate investigation into sexually charged communications between former New York congressman Anthony Weiner and a 15-year-old girl. Comey was briefed on the findings in recent days, resulting in the director's notification to Congress, said the official who is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

The emails were discovered in a search of a device or devices used by Weiner, who is separated from longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Abedin also had access to the same device or devices.

The official said it was not likely that the FBI's review of the additional emails could be completed by Election Day.

In a brief news conference in Iowa on Friday evening, Clinton said, ""The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately,"" a position earlier outlined in a statement from her campaign chairman, John Podesta. The Democratic nominee called on the FBI ""to release all the information that it has.""

""As you know I've had plenty of words about the FBI lately, but I give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong. Justice will prevail,""  Donald Trump said at a campaign rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Thursday night.

During a speech in New Hampshire earlier in the day, the Republican presidential nominee gleefully discussed the ""breaking news announcement.""

""Hillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,"" Trump said, and her ""criminal scheme"" should not be allowed in the Oval Office.

""Perhaps justice will be done,"" the GOP nominee said of the development.

In his statement, Podesta demanded that the FBI director ""provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter'' to lawmakers.

""Upon completing this investigation more than three months ago, FBI Director Comey declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call,'' Podesta said. ""In the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

""It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election,"" Podesta added.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Friday, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said nothing had ""surfaced to change the president's opinion and views of Secretary Clinton.''

""He's going to be proud to support her from now until Election Day,"" Schultz said.

In July, Comey announced that while Clinton and her aides during her tenure as secretary of State had been ""extremely careless"" in the way they'd handled classified information, he recommended that no criminal charges be filed.

In her press conference Friday, Clinton said she was ""confident"" whatever is included in the new messages under review ""will not change the conclusion reached in July.""

In July, Comey testified before skeptical Republican lawmakers to explain the bureau's recommendation, which had been adopted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

“We’re mystified and confused by the fact pattern you laid out and the conclusion you reached,"" House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told Comey.

Comey, however, was unequivocal in maintaining that the conclusion of investigators was not a close call.

“There is no way anybody would bring a case against John Doe or Hillary Clinton for the second time in 100 years based on those facts,"" he told the House panel on July 7.

Trump has cited the closed FBI probe as evidence that the election was ""rigged"" against him, and at a recent debate the GOP nominee said that, if he's elected president, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton.

""Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame,"" said House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.

""This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators,"" Ryan said in a statement, adding that he was again calling for Clinton to no longer receive classified briefings, a traditional courtesy afforded major-party presidential nominees.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the timing of the decision, so soon before the election, demonstrated ""how serious this discovery must be.""

Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, wrote on Twitter that ""a great day in our campaign just got even better.""

Meanwhile, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement that ""without knowing how many emails are involved, who wrote them, when they were written or their subject matter, it’s impossible to make any informed judgment on this development.""

She added: ""The FBI has a history of extreme caution near Election Day so as not to influence the results. Today’s break from that tradition is appalling.”

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi accused Republicans of attempting to ""misrepresent'' the FBI's work.

""Sadly but predictably, Republicans are doing their best to ... warp the FBI’s work to serve their partisan conspiracy-mongering against Hillary Clinton,'' Pelosi said.

The uncertainty of what the new FBI review will yield, and when it will be completed, leaves open the question of how much of an impact it will have on the presidential campaign, as Trump looks to mount what would be a historic comeback, as polls show him trailing nationally and in key battleground states.

""Unless the FBI closes this new investigation one way or the other next week, the likely impact will be to cut into Clinton’s margin, with the bigger effect being on down-ballot races than on the outcome of the presidential election,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, in an emailed statement.

Whatever the long-term impact, the short-term jolt to Trump and his supporters, at least, seemed clear.

In his New Hampshire speech, the GOP nominee suggested the rest of his message for the day would no longer matter as much, given the FBI announcement.

""The rest of my speech is going to be so boring,"" he joked.

0,WELFake Dataset,"(Reuters) - The communications director for U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore has resigned amid the Alabama Republican’s efforts to combat allegations of sexual misconduct that have roiled his campaign. News of the departure of John Rogers came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump defended Moore from accusations by multiple women that Moore pursued them as teenagers when he was in his 30s, including one who has said he initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14. Moore has denied any wrongdoing and has accused the women of conspiring with Democrats, media outlets and establishment Republicans in an effort to tarnish his reputation. Reuters has not independently confirmed any of the accusations. “As we all know, campaigns make changes throughout the duration of the campaign,” campaign Chairman Bill Armistead said in a statement on Wednesday. “John made the decision to leave the campaign last Friday - any representations to the contrary are false - and we wish him well.” Fox News journalist Dan Gallo said on Twitter that Brett Doster, a Moore campaign adviser, told him: “Unfortunately John just did not have the experience to deal with the press the last couple of weeks, and we’ve had to make a change.” Doster did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Moore, 70, a conservative Christian and former Alabama chief justice, won the nomination for the Dec. 12 special election in a hotly contested primary against incumbent Senator Luther Strange. Strange, who was appointed to fill the Senate vacancy left by Jeff Sessions, now U.S. attorney general, was backed by Republican leaders, including the president, while Moore’s campaign attracted support from insurgent right-wing figures like former Trump strategist Steve Bannon. Trump told reporters on Tuesday, however, that he might yet campaign for Moore, who he said “totally denies” the misconduct allegations, and that Democratic nominee Doug Jones was a liberal who should not be elected. The president’s stance stood in contrast to the reactions from most Republicans in Washington, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who have called on Moore to step aside. Jones released a campaign advertisement on Wednesday featuring the nine women who have accused Moore of improper conduct. “They were girls when Roy Moore immorally pursued them,” the narrator says, as photos of the women as young girls flash on the screen. “Will we make their abuser a U.S. senator?” ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar will buy fighter jets and armored vehicles as part of 12 billion euros worth of commercial contracts it agreed with France on Thursday, bolstering its military capability and its international ties as it faces a boycott by other Arab states. The latest contracts underscored how Doha can use the wealth it has accumulated as the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas to defy some of the largest and wealthiest Arab countries. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade relations with the emirate almost six months ago. They accuse the Qataris of backing terrorism, which Qatar denies.  Our position on this blockade was very clear. Qatar s position was very clear - to resolve this problem, if we saw problems between us and our neighbors - we should be at a table and speak honestly,  Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said at a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron, who has tried to play a mediation role between the sides, was in Doha to discuss how to combat the financing of terrorism at a time when the Middle East is locked in a regional power struggle between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran.  Restoring stability to the Gulf is a priority for us because we have a lot of friends here,  Macron said.  Our wish is that we find a quick resolution to today s situation.  Paris has strong commercial and political ties with Qatar. It has promoted deeper business interests in the country and encouraged Qatari investment in France, where the Gulf state already has assets of about $10 billion. Macron said some 12 billion euros ($14.13 billion) worth of deals were agreed on Thursday. They included Qatar s taking up an option from 2015 to buy 12 more Dassault Aviation-made Rafale fighters, and saying it could purchase a further 36. It has already bought 24 planes for about 6 billion euros, including missiles. It also committed to buying 490 armored vehicles from defense firm Nexter.  Doha has repeatedly called for dialogue with its neighbors, although it has strengthened its military as relations with them have deteriorated. It has secured this year alone military equipment deals with the United States, Russia and Britain.   In total, it amounts to nearly 12 billion euros which was signed today and which underlines the closeness of our economic cooperation,  Macron said. Among other deals signed, Suez SEVI.PA will dredge and clean Qatar s lagoon and a rail consortium of RATP and SNCF will build and operate a metro system in the Qatari capital. Qatar Airways also placed a new order for Airbus A321neo civilian aircraft to replace an earlier A320neo order. The new deal for larger planes is worth an extra $930 million at current list prices for Airbus and involves a switch of engine supplier to a French-American venture co-owned by Safran (SAF.PA)< and General Electric (GE.N).

He yelled  You re all Goebbels In case you don t know:GOEBBELS WAS THE NAZI PROPAGANDA MINISTER:German Nazi Party member Joseph Goebbels became Adolf Hitler s propaganda minister in 1933, which gave him power over all German radio, press, cinema, and theater.In 1925 Goebbels met the party leader Adolf Hitler. In 1926 he was made Gauleiter, or party leader, for the region of Berlin, and in 1927 he founded and became editor of the official National Socialist periodical Der Angriff (The Attack). He was elected to the Reichstag, the German parliament, in 1928. By exploiting mob emotions and by employing all modern methods of propaganda Goebbels helped Hitler into power. His work as a propagandist materially aided Hitler s rise to power in 1933. When Hitler seized power in 1933, Goebbels was appointed Reichsminister for propaganda and national enlightenment. From then until his death, Goebbels used all media of education and communications to further Nazi propagandistic aims, instilling in the Germans the concept of their leader as a veritable god and of their destiny as the rulers of the world. In 1938 he became a member of the Hitler cabinet council. Late in World War II, in 1944, Hitler placed him in charge of total mobilization. As Reichsminister for Propaganda and National Enlightenment, Goebbels was given complete control over radio, press, cinema, and theater; later he also regimented all German culture. Goebbels placed his undeniable intelligence and his brilliant insight into mass psychology entirely at the service of his party. His most virulent propaganda was against the Jews. As a hypnotic orator he was second only to Hitler, and in his staging of mass meetings and parades he was unsurpassed. Utterly cynical, he seems to have believed only in the self-justification of power. He remained loyal to Hitler until the end. On May 1, 1945, as Soviet troops were storming Berlin, Goebbels committed suicide.Via: whale",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Share on Facebook Russia is ready and looks forward to restoring bilateral relations with the United States, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, commenting on the news of Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election. “We heard [Trump's] campaign rhetoric while still a candidate for the US presidency, which was focused on restoring the relations between Russia and the United States,” President Putin said, speaking at the presentation ceremony of foreign ambassadors' letters of credentials in Moscow. “We understand and are aware that it will be a difficult path in the light of the degradation in which, unfortunately, the relationship between Russia and the US are at the moment,” he added. Speaking about the degraded state of relations between the countries, the president once again stressed that “it is not our fault that Russia-US relations are as you see them.” Earlier today, in a message to Donald Trump the Russian President expressed confidence that the dialogue between Moscow and Washington, in keeping with each other's views, meets the interests of both Russia and the US. The Russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some “burning issues that are currently on the international agenda, and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security,” RIA Novosti reported. On top of it, Putin has expressed confidence that “building a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each other's positions, meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.” Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin has also expressed hope that Trump's victory in the presidential election will help pave the way for a more constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington. “The current US-Russian relations cannot be called friendly. Hopefully, with the new US president a more constructive dialogue will be possible between our countries,” he said. “The Russian Parliament will welcome and support any steps in this direction,” Volodin added on Wednesday. Commenting on Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia will judge the new US administration by its actions and take appropriate steps in response. “We are ready to work with any US leader elected by the US people,” the minister said on Wednesday. “I can't say that all the previous US leaders were always predictable. This is life, this is politics. I have heard many words but we will judge by actions.” According to many observers, US-Russia relations are now at their lowest point since the Cold War. Putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of Russia's relations with the US “was not our choice,” however. For things to improve between Moscow and Washington, the US should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect Russia's interests rather than try to dictate terms, Putin said last month. The US will have to negotiate with Russia on finding solutions to international issues as no state is now able to act alone, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week, adding that problems in bilateral relations began to mount long before the Ukrainian crisis broke out in 2014.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Treasury, Bank of England and IMF Brexit forecasts proved wrong Published: October 29, 2016 Source: Express UK 
THE Treasury, Bank of England and International Monetary Fund (IMF) are among the self-appointed anti-Brexit so-called economics experts who keep getting their forecasts WRONG. The IMF were among the institutions that forecast an economic disaster if Britain voted to Brexit 
Establishment institutions, as well as global investment banks, issued united and terrifying warnings of economic disaster if Britain opted out of the European Union (EU), in an effort to sway the public into voting to Remain. 
Yet figures released yesterday showed booming Britain's economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the three months after the vote, providing the crowning piece of unarguable evidence that the vote to leave did not negatively impact the UK. 
The Treasury, under the leadership of George Osborne, had predicted Britain would fall into immediate recession after a Brexit vote, with GDP coming in at -0.1 per cent in the third quarter of 2016. 
But yesterday the Treasury admitted the claim had been based on GUESSWORK which turned out to be wholly ill-informed. 
Despite the rank amateurism and inaccuracy of almost all forecasts since Brexit a negative report on Britain’s economic competence – and since Brexit they have almost ALL been negative – risks serious harm to the welfare of the nation. 
The IMF said Brexit could reduce the UK economy by as much as 9.5 per cent, and added that Britain could expect ""sizeable"" long-term losses in income. 
Head of the IMF Christine Lagarde had the audacity to say she could not see ANYTHING positive to come from leaving the EU and an exit could have ""particularly severe"" consequences. 
Ms Lagarde added that interest rates could also rise sharply in the event of leaving Europe, which would negatively impact on households with high debts.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders appealed for unity in a last-ditch effort to break their deadlock on sharing out refugees by June, telling reluctant eastern states they could otherwise be outvoted on a dispute that has shaken the bloc s foundations. Coming out from a fraught discussion among 28 EU leaders that went into the small hours on Friday morning in Brussels, rivals in the two-year-old dispute all stuck to their guns, hemmed in by expectations they have raised with their own voters. The Mediterranean frontline states Italy and Greece, and the rich destination countries including Germany, Sweden, Belgium, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands are demanding that all countries host some refugees as a way to demonstrate solidarity. Their four ex-communist peers Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic refuse to accept people from the mostly-Muslim Middle East and North Africa, saying that would threaten their security after a raft of Islamic attacks in Europe.   There are areas where there is no solidarity and this is something I find unacceptable,  German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters. At one point during the two days of talks in Brussels, cameras caught Merkel, the bloc s paramount national leader, as she appeared to become agitated when talking with the leaders  chairman, Donald Tusk, making her displeasure with him clear. That came after Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland,  came out strongly against  ineffective  and  highly divisive  obligatory refugee quotas, ruffling the feathers of those states that back them as well as the executive European Commission.  The manner in which the principle of solidarity was being questioned does not only undermine the discussion on the refugee issue, but the future of Europe,  Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told reporters after what he called  intense  talks. Tusk said the ineffectiveness of relocation schemes was demonstrated by the fact that only 35,000 asylum seekers had been transferred from Greece and Italy under a 2015 plan meant to move 160,000 people.  Mandatory quotas remain a contentious issue,  Tusk told a joint news conference with the Commission s head Jean-Claude Juncker, the disagreement between the two playing out visibly despite their usually friendly rapport.  Relocation is not a solution to the issue of illegal migration.   Will a compromise be possible? It appears very hard. But we have to try our very best,  he said, stressing the bloc was in full agreement about making further efforts to tighten its borders and chip in for development and migration-related projects in the Middle East and Africa. After sealing a deal with Ankara in 2016 that cut off arrivals from Turkey to EU state Greece, the bloc is now pushing to stem African immigration to Italy through Libya.  Tusk, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and other leaders said they wanted to make permanent financing available for such activities in the bloc s next long-term budget from 2021. But it is the feud over how to share the burden of caring for those refugees who still make it to Europe that has weakened the bloc s cohesion and undermined member states  trust in each other at a time they need unity to face Brexit. After many months of letting the open wound fester, the backers of quotas made clear they want to move on and would vote on the broader reform of the bloc s asylum system by majority if no compromise acceptable for all is found by June on relocation.   I am not a fan of qualified majority decision-taking but... it can be used,  Juncker said.  Some of our colleagues were openly saying yesterday night that if there is no progress, they will propose qualified majority decision-making procedure.  That would inevitably deepen divisions in the EU and the four eastern states warned that the bloc would shoot itself in the foot should it go down this track.  The only proposal the EU has on the table on asylum reform has most recently been updated by Estonia and attempts to bridge the divide by proposing that any relocation of asylum-seekers from one EU state to another, while obligatory at times of extremely high arrivals, would in fact only take place if both involved agreed voluntarily to the terms. Diplomats in Brussels hoped Italy would be more willing to compromise after it holds elections, most likely in March, and said Germany could reassume the lead on the file after it forms a ruling coalition following an election last September. A senior EU diplomat from one of the pro-quota countries said they would seek to break the united front of the four eastern states to bring down the number of countries that would eventually be defeated in a vote if everything else fails.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The State Department, which was criticized for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, said on Wednesday it failed to meet an end-of-2016 deadline to manage all its email records electronically. The department, and other U.S. government agencies, had more than four years to meet the deadline under an Aug. 24, 2012, directive that aimed to eliminate the use of paper records as much as possible in favor of electronic record-keeping. That directive was part of an Obama administration effort to update government record-keeping for the digital age and promote accountability for official decisions by ensuring they are properly documented and preserved for future generations. In a report posted by the National Archives on Wednesday, the State Department checked the “No” box in response to a question on whether it had met the goal of managing all its email records in an electronic format by Dec. 31, 2016. In the report, the State Department said it had met the goal on its main, centralized email systems accounting for the “overwhelming majority” of its emails. “However, the Department does have additional email systems that require further evaluation before we will certify that all email records are managed in an electronic format,” it said, saying it was working hard to “fully meet” the goal. The State Department had no immediate comment on the matter. The department’s record-keeping and email archiving practices attracted scrutiny during the 2016 presidential campaign when the New York Times reported that Clinton had used a private email server as secretary of state. The Democrat’s use of the server to conduct official business throughout her 2009-2013 State Department tenure was criticized by Republican Donald Trump, who defeated her for the presidency in last November’s election. An internal government watchdog issued a report last year that found Clinton broke government rules by using the private email server for her work as America’s top diplomat without approval. The State Department’s Office of the Inspector General said it found no evidence Clinton sought permission to use a server at her Chappaqua, New York, home to handle her work emails and it quoted officials as saying they would have rejected her doing so if they had been asked. The report also found problems in department record-keeping practices before Clinton’s tenure, and it documented how slowly the department had moved to bring record-keeping into the age of electronic communications.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Only days after the worst mass shooting in the nation s history happened against the LGBT community, the GOP decided they could go back to being discriminatory.One would think they d wait at least a week, but apparently three days seemed long enough to mourn the loss of those who perished at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, because according to Vanity Fair:Republican leaders in the House of Representatives blocked a vote on a proposal that would ensure federal contractors can t discriminate against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identification.That s right, you read that correctly, they seem to think it s perfectly acceptable for federal contractors to be able to fire someone for being gay.According to The Hill:Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), who is gay, filed an amendment to a Defense Department spending bill that would enforce a 2014 executive order prohibiting discrimination against LGBT people.Yet, the House Rules Committee didn t see it worthy of consideration and wouldn t even allow it to be voted upon. Nope, not even a vote. Not even a chance.Apparently, the House GOP doesn t want anything added to the annual spending bills for fear that it may inhibit passage. You know, because adding non-discriminatory amendments for LGBT people in a House of Representatives full of GOP bigots doesn t go over well and could clog up business as usual.As The Hill explains:House GOP leaders decided to clamp down on amendments to annual spending bills after Maloney s proposal threatened passage of other appropriations measures last month. Before now, Republicans had been considering appropriations bills under a procedure allowing members of either party to offer unlimited amendments.Don t you see, they only want to play by their rules. If you re not doing something they like, well, then they will make sure it never happens, but guaranteed if it was the other way around, the story would be verrrry different.This just proves, yet again, that Republicans only care about themselves.Featured Photo by Allison Shelley/Getty Images",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will admit a maximum of 45,000 refugees during the 2018 fiscal year, President Donald Trump said in a memorandum to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and released by the White House on Friday. The cap, the lowest in decades, was proposed by the administration in a report to Congress on Wednesday. Refugee advocates say the lower limit ignores growing humanitarian crises around the world that are causing people to flee their native countries in greater numbers, and represents a departure from U.S. global leadership. The Trump administration says the lower cap is necessary so that U.S. officials can address a growing backlog of people applying for asylum inside the United States, and to do better vetting of refugees. In its report to Congress, which was reviewed by Reuters, the administration said it may assess refugees on their ""likelihood of successful assimilation and contribution to the United States."" (tmsnrt.rs/2yHEKpk) An assimilation standard for refugees would be a departure from recent practice but on its face is not inappropriate, said Joseph Cassidy, a fellow at the Wilson Center and former State Department official. “The particular concern is that assessments could be made, not on the basis of individual cases, but might be biased against certain religions or nationalities,” Cassidy said.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"After learning she had a high genetic risk for breast cancer, Dane’e McCree, like a growing number of women, decided to have her breasts removed. Her doctor assured her that reconstructive surgery would spare her nipples and leave her with   breasts. It did. But while Ms. McCree’s rebuilt chest may resemble natural breasts, it is now completely numb. Her nipples lack any feeling. She cannot sense the slightest touch of her breasts, perceive warmth or cold, feel an itch if she has a rash or pain if she bangs into a door. And no one warned her. “I can’t even feel it when my kids hug me,” said Ms. McCree, 31, a store manager in Grand Junction, Colo. who is raising two daughters on her own. Plastic surgeons performed more than 106, 000 breast reconstructions in 2015, up 35 percent from 2000. And they have embraced   techniques to improve the appearance of reconstructed breasts and give them a more natural “look and feel”  —   using a woman’s belly fat to create the new breast, sparing the nipple, minimizing scarring with creative incisions and offering enhancements like larger, firmer lifted breasts. Doctors often promise patients that their reconstructed breasts will look even better than the breasts they had before. But they often describe the potential consequences of the surgery in ambiguous terms. Women say the fact that sensation and sexual arousal will not be restored is not made clear. The main problem is using the word “feel,” said Dr. Clara Lee, an associate professor of plastic surgery at Ohio State University who does reconstructive breast surgery. Surgeons who use a woman’s own tissue to recreate a breast might tell the patient that it will “feel” like a natural breast, referring to how it feels to someone else, not the woman. “We don’t always mean what’s important to the patient,” Dr. Lee said. “Our focus has been on what women look like,” said Dr. Andrea L. Pusic, a plastic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who specializes in breast reconstruction and studies patients’ quality of life after breast surgery. “What it feels like to the woman has been a kind of blind spot in breast surgery. That’s the next frontier. ” The focus on how breasts look and feel to other people, rather than how they feel to the patient, speaks to the fact that women are still largely judged by their appearance, said Victoria   a professor and the head of feminist, gender and sexuality studies at Wesleyan University. “There’s such a strong cultural gaze at women’s breasts,” Dr.   said. “It does raise the question: Who is breast reconstruction for?” Adding to the confusion has been the excitement over surgical innovations, particularly “ ” mastectomies. During a traditional mastectomy, doctors remove the nipple and scoop out breast tissue, causing considerable nerve damage. But now, in certain cases, the nipple can be spared, raising hopes that some feeling will be preserved. The actress Angelina Jolie wrote about her   preventive double mastectomy in a New York Times   in 2013, inspiring other women at high risk of breast cancer to have their breasts removed. But the   surgery has yet to fulfill its promise, and in most cases, sensation is not restored. For many women, the loss of sensation in their breasts can be devastating. “No one said, ‘You will not have sexual arousal in your chest again,’” Ms. McCree said. “I thought that because I was able to keep my nipples and the blood supply, I’d keep my feeling. ” Eve Wallinga, 60, a cancer survivor from St. Cloud, Minn. said many women who choose   mastectomies believe that reconstructive surgery will make them “whole” again and are not told that the sensation lost during the surgery is unlikely to come back. “They go into it thinking everything will be the same when they come out  —   they’ll just have   stuffing in their breasts,” Ms. Wallinga said. “Some are very angry and upset, and say, ‘Why wasn’t I told?’ They feel very betrayed. ” The lack of sensation is potentially dangerous. Women who have had mastectomies and reconstruction surgery have sustained severe burns on their breasts from heating pads, hair dryers, curling irons, sunbathing and overly hot showers. Several women interviewed recounted times when they had not realized a bra was cutting into their skin until they saw blood. Many described embarrassing “wardrobe malfunctions,” when a bathing suit or   shifted to reveal part of their breast without their knowing because they did not feel the air on their exposed skin. A doctor recalled a patient who had burned herself while draining hot pasta for dinner she did not realize she was hurt until she saw red marks on her skin in the shower several hours later. Some women described losing the sense of the position of their breasts. “It’s not just about the sexual arousal, it’s the awkwardness,” said Cathy Balsamo of Berkeley Heights, N. J. “You can’t figure out your space  —   almost like you’re bigger than you really are. It’s a bizarre feeling. ” She added, “When I put on a sports bra, I have to look in the mirror and focus on the breasts to make sure they’re in the pocket where they belong. ” Nerve damage during mastectomies can create   pain syndrome. Some women experience tingling sensations, and others have debilitating pain. Patients say physicians minimize the condition, even though it is fairly common, affecting anywhere from 25 percent to 60 percent of mastectomy patients, according to published studies. Michelle Lamon Romero, 45, of East Longmeadow, Mass. said she had been incapacitated by pain since having a double mastectomy two years ago. She lost her job and now relies on a cocktail of five drugs to keep the pain at a manageable level. “The surface of the skin is numb  —   if you run a needle over it, I can’t feel it,” Ms. Romero said. “But I can feel the pain underneath just radiating everywhere. ” She added that her plastic surgeon had told her that she was an anomaly and that “this isn’t real, it’s all in your head. ” Other patients Ms. Romero has met through Facebook have had the same experience. “So many women who join are just relieved to know they’re not alone,” Ms. Romero said. “They all start out the same way: ‘My doctor told me I was crazy. ’” Most surgeons agree that the best chance for sensory restoration after a mastectomy is a procedure that uses a woman’s own body tissue rather than an implant because nerves have a better chance of regenerating in natural tissue. The procedure has produced modest results. If sensation returns, it is usually limited to the perception of pressure, without improved sensation related to touch, temperature or sexual arousal. “It’s a shadow of the degree of sensation that people had before,” said Dr. Edwin G. Wilkins, a plastic surgeon at the University of Michigan who is running a large study on reconstruction outcomes and complications with Dr. Pusic. “It’s a poor substitute. ” Dr. Aldona J. Spiegel, a plastic surgeon in Houston who has pioneered techniques to reconnect nerves in the breast and restore sensation, said the procedure remained promising. “I tell patients that if I am able to reconnect nerves in the reconstructed breast, it will improve the sensation. But I never tell them it will be normal,” Dr. Spiegel said. She added that many of her patients had shown “very significant improvement. ” One of her patients, Karen Holt, 65, a retired principal from Houston, had her left breast removed and reconstructed from her own tissue 14 years ago. Ms. Holt knows she’s unusual, she said, but claims she has “just about as much erogenous sensation in the left breast as in the right. ” But doctors say such results are rare. “You don’t want to give people false hope,” said Dr. Frank J. DellaCroce, a plastic surgeon and a founder of the Center for Restorative Breast Surgery in New Orleans. Restoring sensation is “one of those things that’s regarded as the holy grail of breast reconstruction,” he said. “But no one has shown in any scientific article to date that we’re able to return sensation in any reliable way. ” Dr. Christine Laronga, a breast oncologist at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fla. said she tried to make clear to patients that feeling would not be restored after reconstruction, telling them, “It may look like a breast, but it won’t feel like a breast. ” While doctors agree on the need for a mastectomy procedure that spares nerves, they note that the goal of the surgery is to make sure the cancer is gone. There is also a risk that efforts to restore sensation will trigger a pain syndrome. “It’s a very tricky area,” said Dr. Ida K. Fox, a plastic surgeon at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in breast and hand surgery. “You don’t want to restore sensation and give someone chronic pain. ” Ms. Balsamo, 50, who had a double mastectomy after testing positive for a genetic mutation that increases breast cancer risk, said she did not regret the surgery, but wished she had been better informed. “I just wish I had known,” Ms. Balsamo said. “They said there’s going to be a difference in the sensation  —   not that there wouldn’t be any.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Reza Zarrab, a prominent Turkish gold trader who has been jailed in New York on charges of violating the United States sanctions on Iran, has added Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, to his legal team, adding intrigue to a case that has been steeped in international politicking between Turkey and the United States. Just last month, Mr. Giuliani and another prominent lawyer, Michael B. Mukasey, traveled to meet with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as part of their efforts on behalf of Mr. Zarrab, according to a person briefed on the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the trip. Mr. Giuliani is close to President Donald J. Trump, raising the question of whether Mr. Zarrab has retained him in an effort to negotiate a beneficial resolution of his case at the highest levels of the Trump administration.  Mr. Mukasey is a former federal judge and attorney general in the George W. Bush administration. Since Mr. Trump’s election, there has been a warming of ties between Turkey and the United States, with officials close to Mr. Erdogan quoted as saying they see the prospect of a fresh start in relations. The United States attorney’s office in Manhattan said in a court filing on Monday evening that it was told that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mukasey “have been retained by the defendant and are involved in, and will continue to be involved in, efforts to explore a potential disposition of the criminal charges in this matter. ” Mr. Zarrab, 33, who was born in Iran and moved to Turkey as an infant, has dual citizenship. He was arrested in March 2016 as he arrived on a trip to Miami, and was sent to New York to face charges. Prosecutors, arguing against bail, said Mr. Zarrab had used his considerable wealth and influence to be released from a prison in Turkey after he was detained there in 2013 as part of a corruption investigation of businessmen with close ties to Mr. Erdogan, then Turkey’s prime minister. Mr. Erdogan has publicly criticized Mr. Zarrab’s prosecution in the United States. According to Turkish news reports, Mr. Erdogan said last fall that he had raised Mr. Zarrab’s case with   President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. during talks at the United Nations, and Mr. Erdogan also said there were “malicious” intentions in the prosecution, according to the reports. Mr. Zarrab has been charged with facilitating millions of dollars in illicit transactions on behalf of Iran and other sanctioned entities through the use of front companies and false documentation. Prosecutors have said he “allegedly tricked numerous U. S. financial institutions into processing barred transactions. ” Mr. Zarrab has also been charged with conspiracies to commit money laundering and bank fraud. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and was ordered detained without bond. Mr. Zarrab’s decision to retain Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mukasey was revealed on Monday in a court filing by the office of Joon H. Kim, the acting United States attorney in Manhattan, who took office this month after Preet Bharara was dismissed by the Trump administration. Mr. Kim’s office said it was advising the judge, Richard M. Berman, of potential conflicts of interest posed by representation of Mr. Zarrab by the two lawyers, noting that Mr. Giuliani’s firm, Greenberg Traurig, and Mr. Mukasey’s firm, Debevoise  Plimpton, had each represented banks that prosecutors say were victims in the case. Mr. Kim’s office asked that the judge hold a hearing on the issue. Mr. Zarrab’s lead lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, responded in a letter to the judge, saying no hearing was necessary because no lawyers from either firm “will have any involvement in the trial preparation or trial in this case, and neither Mr. Giuliani nor Mr. Mukasey intends to file a notice of appearance before your honor. ” “Their roles will not require any appearing in court,” Mr. Brafman wrote. Mr. Brafman, Mr. Mukasey and a spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani each had no comment on Monday. The United States attorney’s office also declined to comment. Mr. Kim’s office, responding with the filing in the evening, argued that a hearing was “especially appropriate and necessary at this time if, as the letter from defense counsel indicates, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mukasey’s involvement in this case is intended to occur entirely outside of the court’s purview and knowledge. ” Adding to the intrigue surrounding the Zarrab case is the fact that Mr. Giuliani has recommended Mr. Mukasey’s son, Marc L. Mukasey, a fellow lawyer at Greenberg Traurig, to Mr. Trump to become the next United States attorney in Manhattan, according to two people briefed on the discussions. The firm’s spokeswoman said the younger Mr. Mukasey has no involvement in the Zarrab case.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"BOSTON (Reuters) - (Editor’s note: This story contains language in the second paragraph that may offend readers) The president of Maine’s state Senate on Friday said he would not pursue a special session to censure Governor Paul LePage for leaving a profanity-laden voicemail message for a lawmaker amid a dispute about the governor’s comments on race and drug dealing. Senator Michael Thibodeau, who like LePage is a Republican, earlier in the week had said he was interested in a one-day special session to officially reprimand the two-term governor for calling a Democratic state legislator a “little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker.” But on Friday he said he would not follow the lead of state House Speaker Mark Eves, who began polling lawmakers in his chamber as to whether they were ready to call a special session “to take action regarding the Governor’s conduct.” “He is unfit to serve as Governor and must resign or be removed from office,” Eves said of LePage in a statement on Friday. That query, Thibodeau said, went further than Senate Republicans were willing to go, adding that his party had been ready to vote for a one-day session to vote on an official censure of LePage, whose current term extends through 2018. “We’re not interested in coming back for impeachment,” Thibodeau told reporters. The state House and Senate both adjourned in April and are not due to meet again until after the November elections. LePage has faced a flurry of criticism over the past week for saying that members of minority groups from out of state were responsible for the lion’s share of the heroin trade in Maine. He drew further criticism after leaving a profane and widely circulated voicemail for a lawmaker that he believed had called him a racist. Earlier in the week he mused during a 15-minute radio interview about the idea of not finishing out his term, only to come back a day later to say that he would not resign. Earlier this year a group of lawmakers started an effort to impeach him, contending the governor overstepped his authority by threatening to withhold funds from a nonprofit group that hired a political rival, but that effort collapsed before making it to the full House. Under Maine’s constitution, Thibodeau would have been first in line to succeed LePage if he stepped down or was removed from office. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Donald Trump woke up on Wednesday morning and lashed out at the media again.The temper tantrum was aimed at the New York Times because they talked to a Republican senator who attended a meeting at the White House Trump organized to discuss the healthcare bill.Earlier this week, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the Trumpcare bill will cause 22 million Americans to lose their insurance and that premiums would skyrocket by 74 percent on top of taking away many of the protections that the Affordable Care Act currently provides.Faced with heavy opposition to the Republican repeal effort, Trump invited Senate Republicans to the White House to discuss the matter. It did not go well. The meeting went off the rails because, the senators found, Trump doesn t know a damn thing about the bill.According to the New York Times,A senator who supports the bill left the meeting at the White House with a sense that the president did not have a grasp of some basic elements of the Senate plan   and seemed especially confused when a moderate Republican complained that opponents of the bill would cast it as a massive tax break for the wealthy.Again, the Times spoke to a person who was actually at the meeting.But Trump whined about the report anyway and complained that the Times did not call him to confirm the story, which we all know he would not have done because Trump thinks any news story about his incompetence is  fake news.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Nine busloads of immigrant activists from Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island will depart before dawn for the trip to Washington, intent on making their voices heard. They will be blasting protest playlists while carrying posters and flags, from the familiar rainbow to the worn colors of Haiti. But they are not going to the better known Women’s March on Washington, planned for Jan. 21, the day after Donald J. Trump’s inauguration. Instead, they are headed to the nation’s capital on Saturday for a more modest rally focused on the rights of immigrants, called We Are Here to Stay and scheduled to start at 11 a. m. at the Metropolitan A. M. E. Church. For these groups, there was a practical, if not urgent, reason to hold the rally on Jan. 14: Barack Obama will still be president. “As an organizer, the 14th is a date that I feel safe mobilizing people to Washington,” said Natalia Aristizabal, of Make the Road New York, one of the rally’s sponsors. “We don’t know what’s going to happen after the inauguration. ” National and local organizers said they were concerned about the possibility of undocumented protesters being arrested during the new administration, especially since Mr. Trump said he planned to deport the two million to three million undocumented immigrants that he said had criminal convictions. Cristina Jiménez, the executive director of United We Dream, the national organization promoting the interests of undocumented youth known as dreamers, called the threat to immigrant communities “imminent” and added: “To be quite frank, we fear the worst. ” That is not to say that immigrants will be avoiding the women’s march. Some organizations, like United We Dream and the New York Immigration Coalition, are partners in both, and there is other overlap. New York’s   Association, which is led by Linda Sarsour, is also a sponsor of the Women’s March, of which Ms. Sarsour is one of the main organizers. Part of the mission statement of the Women’s March calls on “immigrants of all statuses” to attend, but that event has a broader platform that includes issues of pay equity, reproductive rights and safety from domestic violence. Organizers of the immigrant rally said that their protest aims to highlight the disparate groups who make up their movement, and who represent the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the United States. “It’s of the immigrant community, of people of color, it’s broader than people who are first generation,” said Muzna Ansari, 28, the immigrant policy manager for the New York Immigration Coalition. A child of Indian immigrants, she is Muslim. “It’s a moment of connection, too. There are black immigrants who we don’t talk about. ” Ninaj Raoul, a founder and executive director of Haitian Women for Haitian Refugees, said she had seen the immigration rights movement focus on the   Latino community since the 2012 election. But black immigrants, who are far less likely to be undocumented, have pressing issues of their own, she said. “Now more than ever it’s important for the Haitian voice to be heard in this movement,” Ms. Raoul said. “Not just for the incoming government, where we have so many reasons to be worried, but for the current government because of the actions they’ve taken on Haitian immigrants. ” Over the last several months more than 80 Haitian immigrants have walked into her Brooklyn office seeking help, she said, anguished by the shifting American policy that has left them separated from family members. And those living in the city because of temporary protection granted after their country’s 2010 earthquake do not know how long that will last. Migrants from Haiti have flooded the southern border of Mexico since last spring, many making dangerous journeys through nine countries after fleeing South America. In September, the Obama administration detained Haitians at the U. S.  border arriving without visas and ordered deportations. Some pregnant women and mothers with children were given a temporary humanitarian reprieve to stay, but their husbands were deported. After Hurricane Matthew struck in early October, the administration delayed deporting Haitians, but then resumed deportations in November. For Haitians who have been living in the United States with temporary protection granted after the earthquake, that status that is set to expire in July. Ms. Raoul said that because Hurricane Matthew damaged food supplies, those Haitians did not know if they could return. So Haitian immigrants are going to Washington to appeal to Mr. Obama while they still can. They want him to take executive action to grant Haitian migrants at the southern border permission to temporarily enter the United States on humanitarian grounds, and to extend the temporary protections for another 18 months. Ms. Raoul plans to bring 10 Haitian immigrants, and their country’s flag, to Washington. They will take the bus from Sunset Park with 55 young people representing Atlas: D. I. Y. which serves undocumented immigrant youth in the neighborhood. Michelina Ferrara, the deputy director of Atlas, plans to blast her “revolutionary playlist,” with RB and   artists, both on the bus speakers and from her fanny pack. For those not traveling to Washington on Jan. 14, immigrant actions are also planned in 50 other cities. The New York Immigrant Coalition will be kicking off a statewide campaign called This is Our New York with events in Union Square Hempstead, on Long Island and the Hudson Valley. By then, Kathia Gutierrez, 48, will be in Washington with her daughter, Kathya, 29. They arrived 16 years ago from Bolivia. Kathya works as a nanny, saving money for college she can work legally because of President Obama’s program giving certain rights to undocumented immigrants brought to this country as children by their parents. Kathia, her mother, is an activist for Make the Road New York and is going to Washington to deliver a message for   Trump: “Look out for the youth. ” They will be joined by others fighting for their own subset of immigrant rights, including Alexis Pampillón, 44, an Argentine immigrant who identifies as gender nonconforming he and 20 others members of Make the Road’s L. G. B. T. Q. rights group will be leaving from Queens. Make the Road’s members, drawn from places including Bridgeport, Conn. Elizabeth, N. J. and Pennsylvania, will fill eight buses. Not all will fit into the church in Washington, which has a capacity of about 2, 500. More than 3, 000 protesters are expected, organizers said. Some, said Ms. Aristizabal of Make the Road, will stand outside with signs in Spanish and English: “Aquí Estamos y no Nos Vamos,” and “We are Here to Stay. ” That slogan is familiar, she said, adding, “But it has never been so much of a declaration of defiance. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will sign legislation that imposes sanctions on Russia, the White House said on Friday, after Moscow ordered the United States to cut hundreds of diplomatic staff and said it would seize two U.S. diplomatic properties in retaliation for the bill. The U.S. Senate had voted almost unanimously on Thursday to slap new sanctions on Russia, forcing Trump to choose between a tough position on Moscow and effectively dashing his stated hopes for warmer ties with the country or to veto the bill amid investigations in possible collusion between his campaign and Russia. By signing the bill into law, Trump can not ease the sanctions against Russia unless he seeks congressional approval. Moscow’s retaliation, announced by the Foreign Ministry on Friday, had echoes of the Cold War. If confirmed that Russia’s move would affect hundreds of staff at the U.S. embassy, it would far outweigh the Obama administration’s expulsion of 35 Russians in December. The legislation was in part a response to conclusions by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and to further punish Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. Late on Friday, the White House issued a statement saying Trump would sign the bill after reviewing the final version. The statement made no reference to Russia’s retaliatory measures. Russia had been threatening retaliation for weeks. Its response suggests it has set aside initial hopes of better ties with Washington under Trump, something the U.S. leader, before he was elected, had said he wanted to achieve.  Relations were already languishing at a post-Cold War low because of the allegations that Russian cyber interference in the election was intended to boost Trump’s chances, something Moscow flatly denies. Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russian officials.    The Russian Foreign Ministry complained of growing anti-Russian feeling in the United States, accusing “well-known circles” of seeking “open confrontation”. President Vladimir Putin had warned on Thursday that Russia would have to retaliate against what he called boorish U.S. behavior. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Friday that the Senate vote was the last straw. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by telephone that Russia was ready to normalize relations with the United States and to cooperate on major global issues. Lavrov and Tillerson “agreed to maintain contact on a range of bilateral issues”, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. The ministry said the United States had until Sept. 1 to reduce its diplomatic staff in Russia to 455 people, the number of Russian diplomats left in the United States after Washington expelled 35 Russians in December. It was not immediately clear how many U.S. diplomats and other workers would be forced to leave either the country or their posts, but the Interfax news agency cited an informed source as saying “hundreds” of people would be affected. A diplomatic source told Reuters that it would be for the United States to decide which posts to cut, whether occupied by U.S. or Russian nationals.  An official at the U.S. Embassy, who declined to be named because they were not allowed to speak to the media, said the Embassy employed around 1,100 diplomatic and support staff in Russia, including Russian and U.S. citizens. Russian state television channel Rossiya 24 said over 700 staff would be affected but that was not confirmed by the foreign ministry or the U.S. embassy. The Russian Foreign Ministry’s statement said the passage of the bill confirmed “the extreme aggression of the United States in international affairs”. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov met outgoing U.S. ambassador John Tefft on Friday to inform him of the counter measures, Russian news agencies reported. The U.S. Embassy said Tefft had expressed his “strong disappointment and protest”. Most U.S. diplomatic staff, including around 300 U.S. citizens, work in the main embassy in Moscow, with others based in consulates in St Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Vladivostok. The Russian Foreign Ministry said it was also seizing a Moscow dacha compound used by U.S. diplomats for recreation, from Aug. 1, as well as a U.S. diplomatic warehouse in Moscow.  In December, the outgoing Obama administration seized two Russian diplomatic compounds - one in New York and another in Maryland - at the same time as it expelled Russian diplomats. Trump and Putin met for the first time at a G20 summit in Germany this month in what both sides described as a productive encounter, but Russian officials have become increasingly convinced that Congress and Trump’s political opponents will not allow him to mend ties, even if he wants to. The European Union has also threatened to retaliate against new U.S. sanctions on Russia, saying they would harm the bloc’s energy security by targeting projects including a planned new pipeline to bring Russian natural gas to northern Europe.     A European Commission spokesman in Brussels said the bloc would be following the sanctions process closely. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

Как сообщил РИА Новости источник, знакомый с ситуацией, полицейские уже опросили девочек, вернувшихся домой. Никто из подростков противоправных действий не совершал. 
По словам источника агентства, дочь бывшего министра обороны, выбросила мобильный телефон возле метро, документов с собой в ""путешествие"" не взяла. 
27 октября в СМИ появилась информация о том, что в Москве без вести пропали две школьницы . 13-летняя Наталья, дочь Анатолия Сердюкова якобы сбежала из дома вместе с 16-летней подругой. К поиску подростков были подключены сотрудники ФСБ РФ. 
В то же время, источник в правоохранительных органах сообщил РИА Новости, что сообщения о пропаже дочери бывшего министра обороны России Анатолия Сердюкова полицию Москвы не поступали. 
Между тем ""МК"" продолжал настаивать на том, что девочки совершили побег. Якобы школьницы запланировали побег еще несколько дней назад и до этого вели себя очень странно. 
По словам родных 16-летней девочки, в выходные школьница купила походную палатку. А 26 октября, надев теплые вещи, немного перекусила и убежала из дома на глазах удивленных родственников. Позже бы найдена записка со словами: ""Я ушла познавать мир"". 
Родители сразу же обратились в полицию. Тогда и выяснилось, что их ребенок сбежал не один, а с подружкой Наташей. Девочки познакомились в интернете, а за день до побега ходили вместе в театр. 
Как ранее сообщали СМИ, перед побегом 13-летняя дочь Сердюкова также оповестила родителей. Девочка отправила маме смс-сообщение: ""Я ухожу из дома"". Однако телефон беглянка отключила не сразу, поэтому аппарат успели запеленговать.

At the same time, a source in law enforcement agencies told RIA Novosti that the Moscow police had not received any reports of the disappearance of the daughter of former Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov. Meanwhile, ""MK"" continued to insist that the girls had escaped. Allegedly, the schoolgirls had planned their escape several days ago and had been behaving very strangely before that. According to the relatives of the 16-year-old girl, the schoolgirl bought a camping tent on the weekend. And on October 26, she put on warm clothes, had a little snack and ran away from home in front of her surprised relatives. Later, a note was found with the words: ""I've gone to explore the world"". The parents immediately contacted the police. It was then that it became clear that their child had not run away alone, but with her friend Natasha. The girls met on the Internet, and the day before they ran away, they went to the theater together. As previously reported in the media, the 13-year-old daughter of Serdyukov also notified her parents before running away. The girl sent her mother an SMS message: ""I'm leaving home"".

0,WELFake Dataset,"While Hillary doubles down on her false claim that the rules were clarified AFTER she left the State Department, we ve got the 5 top rules she broke. But first we need to listen to the masterful liar herself:Hillary Clinton doubles down on defending her email practices:  Rules were not clarified until after I had left. https://t.co/ggH7XtU5Qo  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) May 26, 2016 That investigation is ongoing, but the report identifies five other laws or regulations that Clinton circumvented or failed to follow. They contradict the Clinton campaign s repeated claims that Clinton s email practices at the State Department complied with all relevant rules regarding federal records and information security.Retaining agency records after leaving  Departing officials and employees [may] not remove Federal records from agency custody   36 C.F.R.   1222.24Clinton s personal email address, which she used exclusively as secretary of state, was housed on a private email server in her Chappaqua, N.Y. home. That meant her emails, which are considered federal records, were never in federal custody while she served as secretary. She didn t just retain records after leaving the State Department; those records were never in the department s possession in the first place.Properly archiving agency records  Agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.   36 C.F.R.   1236.22(b)Clinton claims that the fact she was sending emails to federal employees using official email accounts meant that those emails were being archived properly. The IG rejected that explanation and concluded that Clinton had violated rules on the preservation of federal records. Secretary Clinton should have preserved any Federal records she created and received on her personal account by printing and filing those records with the related files in the Office of the Secretary,  the IG wrote.Preserving federal records from loss or destruction  All Department employees are   required by law to preserve documentary materials meeting the definition of a record under the Federal Records Act [and are] responsible for creating, using, maintaining, preserving, and disposing of the Department s information and records.   State Department Foreign Affairs ManualClinton has said that she deleted roughly 30,000 emails stored on her server that she deemed of a personal and non-official nature. Neither the State Department nor the records agency has ever seen those emails. We now know that they included messages that were official in nature.The IG report identified a number of such emails to Gen. David Petraeus.  The Department of Defense provided to OIG in September 2015 copies of 19 emails between Secretary Clinton and General David Petraeus on his official Department of Defense email account.  None of those 19 emails were turned over to the State Department.Other deleted Clinton emails included dispatches about the Libyan civil war and the Sept. 11, 2012, terrorist attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities in the country.Use of department-approved computing devices  It is the Department s general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized AIS, which has the proper level of security control to provide nonrepudiation, authentication and encryption, to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the resident information.   State Department Foreign Affairs ManualAccording to the inspector general, Clinton never received department approval to conduct official agency business on her private email server. She never consulted with the proper authorities before doing so. If she had, her email arrangement would have been rejected. According to the current CIO and Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security, Secretary Clinton had an obligation to discuss using her personal email account to conduct official business with their offices, who in turn would have attempted to provide her with approved and secured means that met her business needs,  stated the IG report. However, according to these officials, DS and IRM did not and would not approve her exclusive reliance on a personal email account to conduct Department business, because of the restrictions in the FAM and the security risks in doing so. Handling of sensitive-but-unclassified (SBU) information  Where warranted by the nature of the information, employees who will be transmitting SBU information outside of the Department network on a regular basis to the same official and/or most personal addresses, must contact the [information security officials] for guidance in implementing a secure technical solution for those transmissions.   State Department Foreign Affairs Manual Emails exchanged on [Clinton s] personal account regularly contained information marked as SBU,  but she never obtained the required approval for the handling of such information on a personal computing device. Because a security review never occurred,  Secretary Clinton never demonstrated   that her private server or mobile device met minimum information security requirements. Information security officials from Clinton s time at the agency told the IG  that they were not asked to approve or otherwise review the use of Secretary Clinton s server and that they had no knowledge of approval or review by other Department staff. These officials also stated that they were unaware of the scope or extent of Secretary Clinton s use of a personal email account, though many of them sent emails to the Secretary on this account.

Anomalous signals from deep space often evoke a quick pulse of gossip and speculation about aliens that dies off soon thereafter, when scientists are able to explain it. Usually, the explanation involves a natural cosmic process — an asteroid, space detritus, or frequencies from an exploded star.
Sometimes, however, the signals are too mysterious to explain. There’s a reason why you may have seen a sustained social media buzz regarding aliens this past week. A few days ago, two scientists from Laval University in Quebec released a paper arguing they may have just received our first communication from extraterrestrials.
First, a bit of context. This has been an exciting decade for those of us who stargaze in awe, wondering how many sentient beings live in this incomprehensibly enormous universe of ours. First, the search for exoplanets accelerated dramatically, aided by the Kepler telescope, which has identified over 1,000 planets outside of our solar system.
While scientists have long known that our Milky Way galaxy alone probably contains several hundred billion planets , the ability to study them had eluded us until fairly recently (this ability will be exponentially augmented when the James Webb telescope allows us to analyze exoplanets’ atmospheres and search for traces of industrial gasses). Additionally, the discovery of Earth-like exoplanets — some of which are conceivably close enough to visit in a few decades — has tantalizing ramifications for our near future human race.
Earlier this year, scientists announced the incredible observation of a series of inexplicable brightness frequencies from the star KIC 8462852, which led many to speculate the signals could have been originating from a Dyson sphere , a theoretical megastructure by which an advanced alien race (a Kardschez type 2 civilization ) could harness the power of its sun. The newest discovery from this star has made it even more unlikely that the signals are from natural causes.
The newest strange signals hail from a gaggle of some 234 stars identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which analyzed the spectra of 2.5 million stars. E.F. Borra and E. Trottier, the two astronomers who discovered the anomalies, discussed them in their paper , which was originally titled “Signals probably from Extraterrestrial Intelligence.”
“We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an [extraterrestrial intelligence] signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis,” they wrote.
“The fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the ETI hypothesis.” 
Of course, it is far from certain that these are actual alien messages. In an interview with none other than Snopes.com , Borra claimed he never actually used the word ‘probably’ and that further confirmation was needed.
The director of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute , Andrew Siemion, issued an admonishing response:
“You can’t make such definitive statements about detections unless you’ve exhausted every possible means of follow-up.” 
So why is everyone so excited? The discovery appears to match a prediction Borra made in 2012 when he claimed aliens could very well use intermittent bursts of laser as a means of communication.
For his part, Siemion plans to use his Breakthrough Listen Initiative to more closely assess several stars from the 234 sample. Meanwhile, Borra andTrottier, Borra’s graduate student, will continue observing the mysterious signals.
It’s an exciting decade for space research. With plans for a mission to Mars in the hopper, as well as an exploratory probe that will be sent to the moon Europa, we may be witnessing the rebirth of the Space Race. What better incentive could there be to venture further into space than the call of an alien species?
Let’s hope that by the time we meet them, our own species will have transcended its addiction to war and unsustainable resource allocation. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

0,WELFake Dataset,"Things got heated on  The View  on Friday between Whoopi Goldberg and Jedediah Bila on the subject of Planned Parenthood, and Bila got SCHOOLED.The ladies began talking about how House Republicans plan to include defunding Planned Parenthood in their Obamacare repeal bill, which really upset Goldberg.Goldberg went on the offensive by reminding the audience that not one dollar of federal funding pays for abortion services. But by defunding the organization, Republicans would be stripping millions of low income women of vital healthcare services such as breast cancer exams, PAP smears, and contraceptives that would prevent unwanted pregnancies in the first place. Do people still not have their facts straight about who s going to actually be affected by Planned Parenthood s removal?  Goldberg began.  There is no line item in the federal budget that goes to Planned Parenthood. No tax dollars. Can we just say that again? Because the myth of federal tax dollars for abortions has been discredited, we ve said it a million times, all those videos you keep seeing have been discredited. The videos Goldberg is talking about, which she later correctly labeled as  bullshit,  are the deceptively edited videos illegally recorded by anti-abortion fanatics to try and portray Planned Parenthood as a profiteer off abortions. In reality, Planned Parenthood does not profit off of fetal tissue. The organization merely gets reimbursed the cost of shipping from medical and scientific organizations and facilities who need the tissue for research. The only people who are going to eat it when Planned Parenthood goes away are women who need the services,  Goldberg continued.Bila jumped to defend conservatives by whining about how  religious  people don t want their tax dollars going to an organization they don t agree with. And then she had the gall to claim that conservatives don t have a problem with women choosing to have an abortion, which we all know is bullshit considering all the anti-abortion laws conservatives have been pushing for over the years.Apparently it s not, because If it was my right, you wouldn t give a crap whether I was having an abortion,  Goldberg fired back.  Whether you subscribe to people having abortions or not should have nothing to do with what I do or what I need. If I m a low-income person and I ve been raped you don t have the right to tell me if I should have an abortion. And then Goldberg dropped the hammer on Bila by telling her that if conservatives don t want their tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood, then she doesn t want her tax dollars going to paying for Trump s wall. Look, I don t want to pay for this new wall that suddenly we are now paying for. My religious background says that I m supposed to make sure that people are serviced, that s what my religion says. I m not there to judge. God judges. I m paying for stuff I don t want to pay for, she added.  I don t want to pay for a wall My thing about America is that people have to pay their fair share for things they don t like and things they do like. You may not like abortion don t have one. Here s the video via YouTube.And Goldberg is absolutely right. After all, taxpayers were forced by Republicans to pay for abstinence-only sex education programs that don t work, not to mention costly wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and let s go ahead and include the salaries of every Republicans who sat on their ass and did nothing but obstruct over the last eight years instead of helping President Obama rebuild America. I m sure many taxpayers object to their money being used for that as well.The fact is, however, that Planned Parenthood provides healthcare services to millions of low-income women across the country and only 3 percent of those services has to do with abortion. And if Republicans really care about women, they ll stop trying to take their healthcare provider away from them.Featured image via screenshot",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday moved to amend the starting date of its proposed 90-day travel ban on people entering the United States from six Muslim-majority countries in a bid to keep its legal battle alive. The amendment appears intended to avoid the administration’s legal case at the U.S. Supreme Court becoming moot on grounds that parts of the executive order have expired. Challengers to the ban, who say the order is intended to discriminate against Muslims, have said in court papers that it should expire on Wednesday, 90 days after the executive order was due to take effect on March 16. A memo issued by the White House, as the Supreme Court considered two challenges to the ban, said parts of the order put on hold would not expire before they can go into effect, and the start date would be when court injunctions were lifted. The move is part of administration efforts to have the high court rule that the controversial ban should immediately go into effect after Trump’s first attempts to impose travel restrictions were blocked by lower courts.   Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which has challenged the ban, said the need for the revision was a sign of the ban’s legal flaws. “And yet again, these revisions underline that the one thing the president has consistently wanted throughout is a Muslim ban,” he added. Lawsuits by Hawaii and Maryland challengers argued that the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the Constitution’s First Amendment, which prohibits the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. The Trump administration has said it is needed to protect national security. Soon after the memo was issued, Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall filed court papers saying that it resolved “any doubt” about the order’s effective date.  If the case was moot, the nine justices would have no reason to rule on it and lower court rulings against the administration would remain in place. The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the Trump administration more time to file papers responding to an appeals court ruling on Monday that upheld a block on the travel ban. The court’s action likely delayed any decision on administration requests for the ban to go into effect until at least next week.  Federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked Trump’s 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Hawaii judge also blocked a 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the Hawaii injunction on Monday. In the second case, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, on May 25 upheld the Maryland judge’s ruling. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Oil leaks that pose catastrophic risks to the environment, people and water were the reason thousands of protesters risked their lives to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Millions of others around the world showed their support for the protesters and the rights of all people to have access to clean water and a healthy environment.Tragically, the fears of clean water activists around the world are already coming true. The Associated Press reports the Dakota Access Pipeline has already spilled oil onto American soil three separate times   before it s even been fully constructed.According to the North Dakota Health Department, a leaky flange in a pipeline terminal spilled 84 gallons of oil on March 3, in Watford City. The spill was quickly contained and oil flow was stopped on site. According to the department, the contaminated soil and snow were removed and no waterways, people or wildlife were harmed.Two days later a leak of 20 gallons was reported in a rural area of Mercer County by the Federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Again, they stated that no waterways, people or wildlife were harmed.The incident report faults a manufacturing defect as the caused a valve failure and the subsequent leak, which was isolated by closing valves upstream and downstream. All other valves were later inspected and given the OK.Despite the ETP insisting that the pipeline is safe, several native Dakota tribes still fear the future environmental havoc of this 1,200-mile pipeline that will start commercial operation on June 1st.The Standing Rock, Cheyenne River, Oglala Sioux and Yankton Tribes are still fighting to stop the pipeline from operating. They are currently working in court to convince a federal judge to shut it down.The pipeline leaked a third time on April 4th. Eighty-four gallons were spilled at a rural pump station in South Dakota. The SD Department of Environment and Natual Resources reported the spill to its online database but kept it quiet from the public. Apparently, the department s policy is to conduct a press release only if the spill  threatens waterways or public health. In the fight to stop the DAPL, attorneys and local Tribal leaders are using these leaks as evidence that additional environmental reviews are necessary before it becomes fully operational. We have always said it is not a matter of if, but when,  tribal attorney Jan Hasselman said after the South Dakota leak.  Pipelines spill and leak. It s just a fact.

Officially, of course, the national bird of the United States is that half-a-peace-sign that Philadelphia sports fans like to hold up at opposing teams. But unofficially, the film National Bird has it right: the national bird is a killer drone. 
Finally, finally, finally, somebody allowed me to see this movie. And finally somebody made this movie. There have been several drone movies worth seeing , most of them fictional drama , and one very much worth avoiding ( Eye in the Sky ). But National Bird is raw truth, not entirely unlike what you might fantasize media news reports would be in a magical world in which media outlets gave a damn about human life. 
The first half of National Bird is the stories of three participants in the U.S. military’s drone murder program, as told by them. And then, just as you’re starting to think you’ll have to write that old familiar review that praises how well the stories of the victims among the aggressors were told but asks in exasperation whether any of the victims of the actual missiles have any stories, National Bird expands to include just what is so often missing, and even to combine the two narratives in a powerful way. 
Heather Linebaugh wanted to protect people, benefit the world, travel, see the world, and use super cool technology. Apparently our society did not explain to her in time what it means to join the military. Now she suffers guilt, anxiety, moral injury, PTSD, sleep disorder, despair, and a sense of responsibility to speak out on behalf of friends, other veterans, who have killed themselves or become too alcoholic to speak for themselves. Linebaugh helped murder people with missiles from drones, and watched them die, and identified body parts or watched loved ones gather up body parts. 
Even while still in the Air Force, Linebaugh was on a suicide watch list and had a psychologist recommend moving her to a different sort of job, but the Air Force refused. She has episodes. She sees things. She hears things. But she’s forbidden to discuss her work with friends or even with a therapist who doesn’t have the proper “security clearance.” 
We let Daniel down even more than Heather. He says he actually opposed militarism but was homeless and desperate, so he joined the military. We could have given him a house for much less than we paid him to help murder people at Fort Meade. 
Lisa Ling worked on a database filled by drone surveillance that compiled information on 121,000 “targets” in two years. Multiply that by a dozen years. With 90% of victims not among the targets, add up how many people would die in the targeting of the whole list. That’d be over 7 million. But it’s not numbers that have poisoned the souls of these three veterans; it’s children and mothers and brothers and uncles lying in pieces on the ground. 
Ling travels to Afghanistan to see the place at ground level and to meet with drone victims. She meets a little boy who lost his leg and his 4-year-old brother and his sister and his father. On February 2, 2010, drone “pilots” at Creech Air Base murdered 23 innocent members of one family. 
The filmmakers have voices read the written transcript of what the drone operators said to each other before, during, and after sending in the missiles that did the damage. This is worse than Collateral Murder . The people whose job it is to identify children and others who should not be murdered have identified children among the group of people being targeted. The “pilots” at Creech are eager to reject this information and to get onto killing as many people as they can. Their lust for blood drives the decision process. Only after they’ve killed 23 people do they recognize children among the survivors, and the lack of guns. 
We see the bodies brought home to bury. Those injured describe their suffering, physical as well as mental. We see people being fitted with artificial legs. We hear Afghans describe their perception of drones. They imagine, just as many Americans may imagine, and just as viewers of Eye in the Sky would imagine, that drone operators have a clear, high resolution view of everything. In fact, they have a view of fuzzy little blobs on a computer screen that looks like it was created in the 1980s. 
Linebaugh says there is no way to distinguish the little “civilian” blobs from little “militant” blobs. When Daniel hears President Obama claim that there is always near certainty that no civilians will be killed, Daniel explains that such knowledge is simply not possible. Linebaugh says she was often on the side of the conversation telling the “pilots” at Creech not to murder innocents, but that they always pushed for permission to kill. 
Jesselyn Radack, attorney for whistleblowers, says in the film that the FBI told two whistleblowers that a terrorist group had put them on a kill list. She said that the FBI has also contacted Linebaugh’s family and warned her that “terrorists” have been searching for her name online, suggesting that she fix this problem by shutting up. (She had written an op-ed in the Guardian ). 
The FBI also raids Daniel’s house, arriving with 30 to 50 agents, badges, guns, cameras, and search warrants. They take away his papers, electronics, and phone. They tell him he is under investigation for a possible indictment under the Espionage Act. This is the World War I-era law for targeting foreign enemies that President Obama has made a routine of using to target domestic whistleblowers. While Obama has prosecuted more people under this law than did all previous presidents combined, we probably have no way of knowing how many people have been explicitly threatened with the possibility. 
While we should be apologizing to, comforting, and aiding these young people rather than denying them the right to speak to anybody and threatening them with decades in prison, Lisa Ling did manage to find some kindness. Victims of drone strikes in Afghanistan told her that they forgave her. As the film ends, she’s planning another trip to Afghanistan. This entry was posted in General . Bookmark the permalink .

0,WELFake Dataset,"MADRID (Reuters) - A judge will give his ruling on Monday on whether eight pro-independence Catalan politicians charged with sedition should be released from custody so they can contest a regional election set for Dec. 21, judicial sources said on Friday.  The eight, former members of Catalonia s dismissed regional government, appeared before the Supreme Court on Friday to request their release while they await trial in the wake of a disputed independence referendum. Catalan leaders, who previously held a slim parliamentary majority, made a unilateral declaration of independence in defiance of Spanish law on Oct. 27, leading to their arrest and forcing Madrid to take direct control of the region and call the election. The face-off between Barcelona and Madrid has tipped Spain into its worst political crisis in four decades, prompted more than 2,800 companies to move their legal headquarters out of the region, and forced the government to cut growth forecasts. It has also deeply divided people in the wealthy northeastern region and caused resentment in the rest of Spain. Sacked regional vice-president Oriol Junqueras, one of his ERC party s main candidates for the election, has asked to leave jail in order to campaign in the December vote, which pro-independence parties see as a de facto vote on secession. The presiding judge will make his decision on the cabinet members  custody public on Monday, judicial sources said. Any release would likely to be on bail and under strict conditions as the defendants await trial.    Junqueras and seven other former cabinet members were jailed on Nov. 2 pending trial on charges of sedition, rebellion and misappropriation of funds after organizing the illegal secession vote and declaring independence from Spain. Earlier in November, the Supreme Court released Catalan parliament speaker Carme Forcadell on bail of 150,000 euros  ($178,410) after she agreed to renounce any political activity that went against the Spanish constitution. All eight former cabinet members have said they would abide by a ruling giving Madrid control over the region, according to their lawyers, although some of them said they did not agree with this unprecedented move stripping power from the rebel administration. Campaigning for the Dec. 21 election officially starts on Tuesday. The former president of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, in self-imposed exile in Belgium and subject to an arrest warrant from Spain for rebellion and misuse of public funds, has called the elections the most important in the region s history. Barely a quarter of Catalans want to continue with the project of creating an independent state, a survey by pollsters Metroscopia showed. However, the same poll of 1,800 Catalans taken between Nov. 20 and Nov. 22, showed that separatist parties are forecast to win 46 percent of the vote, down slightly from 47.7 percent in a previous election in 2015.  Unionist parties combined would account for another 46 percent of votes, up from less than 40 percent last time. The leaders of Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana (ANC) and Omnium Cultural, Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cuixart   who were imprisoned last month, also testified before the Supreme Court over their role in the independence drive.

There s no smiling because, if for some reason the person experiencing the seizure has not collapsed to the ground in unconsciousness, the moment the body begins to move uncontrollably is terrifying. After a seizure, someone does not instantly jump back into a conversation, making jokes. Eichenwald should know. He has epilepsy.But Fox & Friends has picked up where Hannity left off and made a brand new claim on Thursday in an effort to cast doubt on the health of Hillary s mind.Steve Doocy, who was named in Gretchen Carlson s sexual harassment lawsuit against Roger Ailes, suggested that Hillary Clinton has brain damage because she wears prism eyeglasses. Is that the fact that when we saw Hillary Clinton wearing those prism glasses, a sign of brain damage and other things, and he s worried about the care she s getting so far,  Doocy said in reference to Dr. Drew Pinsky allegedly expressing concern for Hillary s health.Kilmeade then suggested that Clinton s glasses are connected to Benghazi, because conservatives will never stop talking about that. And if you want to   or remember, when she was wearing those glasses, remember when she made those famous line to Senator Ron Johnson,  What difference at this point does it make,  that s when she had those glasses on. Here s the video via Media Matters.This kind of speculation is why Fox should drop the  News  part of their name.Just because Hillary Clinton is wearing prism glasses it does not mean that she has brain damage. It means she has eye problems like 75 percent of Americans do.Hillary wears Fresnel prism glasses to correct double vision resulting from a concussion she sustained in 2012 after she fainted and fell due to dehydration.This in no way disqualifies her from being president. She merely has a vision issue that needs correcting.And if wearing glasses is a sign of brain damage perhaps Fox should have performed a quick search on Google for Donald Trump. Because they would have found this.So does that mean Trump has brain damage? I mean, that would definitely explain Trump s crazy behavior over the last year.Featured image via Twitter",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"BERLIN  —   Three Syrians who entered Germany as migrants have been arrested on suspicion of belonging to the Islamic State and may have links to those who carried out the Paris terrorist attacks last year, the authorities said on Tuesday. Thomas de Maizière, the German interior minister, said the travel documents the men were carrying when they were arrested on Tuesday had been issued by the same authority as ones found on some of the men who carried out the attacks in and around Paris in November. The authorities also said that the three Syrians appeared to have used the same smugglers to enter Germany and to apply for asylum as some of those involved in the terrorist assaults in France. “It could be that this was a sleeper cell,” Mr. de Maizière told reporters. Prosecutors said in a statement that they believed the three came to Germany in November to carry out a planned attack for the group, also known as ISIL or ISIS, or to await instructions for one. While there was no indication the three had been planning a specific attack, prosecutors said they had sufficient evidence to arrest the men on suspicion of membership in a foreign terrorist organization. The German security authorities have been on high alert since two young men who entered the country as migrants carried out separate attacks in Bavaria in July, wounding dozens. Both attacks appeared linked to or inspired by the Islamic State, the authorities said. The three men arrested on Tuesday were identified only by their first names and last initials, in keeping with German privacy laws. They entered the country in November by traveling through Turkey and Greece and had been living in refugee shelters north of Hamburg, the German news media reported. In October, the suspects “pledged to an Islamic State operative responsible for operations and attacks outside of Islamic   territory to travel to Europe,” where they were to carry out a planned attack or await instructions, prosecutors said.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Eric Holder in a dress Eric Holder got the ball rolling for Obama when he used taxpayer dollars to pay people to protest during the Trayvon Martin controversy. Loretta Lynch is just the person to carry his racist torch of injustice for the  oppressed  black man. These people are not capable of colorblind justice. Their desire to punish anyone who disagrees with their radical ideology is much stronger than their desire to see true and honest justice served in America Members of the Black Lives Matter movement should not get  discouraged by those who would use your lawful actions as a cover for their heinous violence,  Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Friday.Her encouragement of the radical movement came a few hours after five officers were gunned down and six were wounded by an African-American radical attacker during a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas.Throughout her Friday statement, she zig-zagged between her calls for more political protests, her suggestions that cops should be blamed for the high number of African-Americans killed during interactions with law enforcement, and her calls for less violence during political protests. After the events this week, Americans across the country are feeling a sense of helplessness, of uncertainty, of fear. Now, these feelings are understandable and they are justified. But the answer must not be violence. The answer must never be violence,  Lynch said. Rather, the answer must be action: calm, peaceful, collaborative and determined action. Calm, peaceful, collaborative and determined action. We must continue working to build trust between communities and law enforcement. We must continue working to guarantee every person in this country equal justice under the law,  she said.She played up the administration s pre-election focus on gun control, instead of the political conflicts that spur violence.  And we must take a hard look at the ease at which wrongdoers can get their hands on deadly weapons, and the frequency with which they use them,  she said.Like many officials, Lynch also implied moral equivalence between the deliberately murdered officers in Dallas and the suspects killed by other police officers on duty.  This has been a week of profound grief and heartbreaking loss. The peaceful protest that was planned in Dallas last night was organized in response to the tragic deaths of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota. We have opened a civil rights investigation in Louisiana and we are providing assistance to local authorities in Minnesota who are leading the investigation there,  said Lynch.Lynch repeatedly appeared to praise Black Lives Matter, though not by name, and encouraged black racial activists to continue demonstrating against police.  To those who seek to improve our country, through peaceful protest and protected speech, I want you to know that your voice is important. Do not be discouraged by those who would use your lawful actions as a cover for their heinous violence,  she continued. We will continue to safeguard your constitutional rights and to work with you in the difficult mission of building a better nation and a brighter future. And to all Americans, I ask you, I implore you: Do not let this week precipitate a new normal in this country. I ask you to turn to each other, not against each other as we move forward. But some of those demonstrators not easily restrained. Some black activists in Dallas called for murdering whites and police officers just last summer, telling one veteran:  We are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife, and your f ing piece of sh-t unborn creature will be hung from a tree. The Attorney General also included some vague calls for unity amid her controversial support for the divisive BLM movement.Via: Breitbart News ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), declined to provide any details on the attacks in a speech scheduled for Wednesday in London. The remarks follow comments on Monday from Prime Minister Theresa May in which she accused Russia of spreading disinformation and meddling in elections, echoing a heated debate in the United States over alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Russian has strongly denied any election interference in the United States. The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond when asked after normal business hours for comment on Martin s remarks. The NCSC, a branch of the GCHQ, Britain s main signals intelligence agency, has been in operation for a year and is charged with shoring up cyber security by working with a wide range of stakeholders. Martin said in his prepared remarks:  I can confirm that Russian interference, seen by the National Cyber Security Centre over the past the year, has included attacks on the UK media, telecommunication and energy sectors.   The agency was  actively engaging with international partners, industry and civil society  to tackle the threat from Russia, he said. Martin echoed May s comments that Russia was trying to  undermine the international system  with information warfare and cyber attacks.  Cyber security experts have long worried about attacks on electrical grids in particular, but Martin offered no evidence that the alleged Russian attacks succeeded in penetrating power systems or other critical infrastructure in the UK.

His latest proposal: revoke the citizenship of American-born children of undocumented immigrants, a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.

On Fox News' ""The O'Reilly Factor"" on Tuesday night, the GOP's presidential frontrunner envisioned kicking all 11 million undocumented immigrants out of the country.

""Do you envision federal police kicking in the doors in barios around the country, dragging families out and putting them on a bus? Do you envision that?"" host Bill O'Reilly asked.

""I don't think they have American citizenship,"" he replied. ""And if you speak to very good lawyers, and I know some would disagree, (but) many agree with me, you will find they do not have American citizenship.""

Trump hasn't said how he would implement his ambitious immigration plan. In New Hampshire Wednesay he talked about building what he calls a beautiful wall.

""I will build the greatest wall that you've ever seen,"" he said. ""I want it to be so beautiful because maybe someday they're gonna call it the Trump Wall, maybe. So I have to make sure it's beautiful, right? I'll be very proud of that wall.""

Up the road at another event in New Hampshire, Jeb Bush took a few swipes at Trump, saying he's not a true conservative.

If McCrory loses to Democratic challenger Roy Cooper, they said, elected officials backing such measures in other states will face greater political risk.  “I believe a strong message already has been sent to lawmakers across the country,” said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) civil rights organization. “I believe and hope on Election Day that an even stronger message will be sent.” The advocacy group has joined with Equality North Carolina for a broad effort to boost voter turnout and unseat McCrory and other supporters of the law known as House Bill 2. The organizations are targeting about 400,000 pro-equality voters in the state, including an estimated 255,800 LGBT voters, Griffin said. The Human Rights Campaign said that voting bloc could make a difference in a presidential swing state where Democrat Barack Obama won by about 14,000 votes in 2008 and Republican Mitt Romney led by about 92,000 votes in 2012. “There’s no question this is going to be a very close race at the top of the ticket, and the LGBTQ voting bloc really has the ability to impact the outcome of this election,” said Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality North Carolina. RACE A TOSS-UP Elections experts consider the race between McCrory and Cooper, one of 12 U.S. gubernatorial seats being decided on Tuesday, to be among the country’s most competitive.  Public opinion polls have been tight most of the year, though the RealClearPolitics average of recent surveys shows Cooper with a slight advantage. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll found that, among residents who expect to vote, 38 percent were less likely to support McCrory’s re-election bid as a result of the law and its fallout, compared with 32 percent who were more likely to support him. The poll was conducted online in English between Oct. 6 and Oct. 19. It included 1,233 likely voters and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. Other polls have shown a majority of residents believe the law is hurting the state. McCrory, who in 2012 became North Carolina’s first Republican governor in two decades, has blamed the backlash against the law on national groups trying to redefine gender and “basic norms of privacy.” Cooper says the law is discriminatory, and he has made McCrory’s support for it a central issue of his campaign. An ad campaign launched last week by the conservative NC Values Coalition accuses Cooper, the state’s attorney general since 2001, of putting women and children at risk by refusing to defend H.B. 2. “By not defending it, he’s allowing men into women’s bathrooms,” the group’s executive director, Tami Fitzgerald, said in a phone interview. “We think that just goes too far.” “Equality NC and HRC have made North Carolina ground zero for their radical LGBT agenda,” she added. “But I believe that their efforts will fail.” At early voting sites in North Carolina this week, the issue appeared to be galvanizing people on both sides. “I admire McCrory for standing behind H.B. 2,” said Republican Parker Umstead, 81, a certified public accountant who cast a ballot in Winston-Salem for the incumbent. “It takes courage to stand up for your beliefs.” But Holly Carpenter, a 41-year-old Republican from Cary who works in the medical field, cited the measure as the prime reason why she voted against McCrory, whom she supported in 2012. “To lose so many economic opportunities over that was just a huge negative for me,” she said.

0,WELFake Dataset,"By Dean Baker, the co-founder of CEPR. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website 
Globalization and technology are routinely cited as drivers of inequality over the last four decades. While the relative importance of these causes is disputed, both are often viewed as natural and inevitable products of the working of the economy, rather than as the outcomes of deliberate policy. In fact, both the course of globalization and the distribution of rewards from technological innovation are very much the result of policy. Insofar as they have led to greater inequality, this has been the result of conscious policy choices. 
Starting with globalization, there was nothing pre-determined about a pattern of trade liberalization that put U.S. manufacturing workers in direct competition with their much lower paid counterparts in the developing world. Instead, that competition was the result of trade pacts written to make it as easy as possible for U.S. corporations to invest in the developing world to take advantage of lower labor costs, and then ship their products back to the United States. The predicted and actual result of this pattern of trade has been to lower wages for manufacturing workers and non-college educated workers more generally, as displaced manufacturing workers crowd into other sectors of the economy. 
Instead of only putting manufacturing workers into competition with lower-paid workers in other countries, our trade deals could have been crafted to subject doctors, dentists, lawyers and other highly-paid professionals to international competition. As it stands, almost nothing has been done to remove the protectionist barriers that allow highly-educated professionals in the United States to earn far more than their counterparts in other wealthy countries. 
This is clearest in the case of doctors. For the most part, it is impossible for foreign-trained physicians to practice in the United States unless they have completed a residency program in the United States. The number of residency slots, in turn, is strictly limited, as is the number of slots open for foreign medical students. While this is a quite blatantly protectionist restriction, it has persisted largely unquestioned through a long process of trade liberalization that has radically reduced or eliminated most of the barriers on trade in goods. The result is that doctors in the United States earn an average of more than $250,000 a year, more than twice as much as their counterparts in other wealthy countries. This costs the country roughly $100 billion a year in higher medical bills compared to a situation in which U.S. doctors received the same pay as doctors elsewhere. Economists, including trade economists, have largely chosen to ignore the barriers that sustain high professional pay at enormous economic cost. 
In addition to the items subject to trade, the overall trade balance is also very much the result of policy choices. The textbook theory has capital flowing from rich countries to poor countries, which means that rich countries run trade surpluses with poor countries. While this accurately described the pattern of trade in the 1990s up until the East Asian financial crisis (a period in which the countries of the region enjoyed very rapid growth), in the last two decades developing countries taken as a whole have been running large trade surpluses with wealthy countries. 
This implies large trade deficits in rich countries, especially the United States, which in turn has meant a further loss of manufacturing jobs with the resulting negative impact on wage inequality. However, there was nothing inevitable about the policy shifts associated with the bailout from the East Asian financial crisis that led the developing world to become a net exporter of capital. 
The pattern of gains from technology has been even more directly determined by policy than is the case with gains from trade. There has been a considerable strengthening and lengthening of patent and copyright and related protections over the last four decades. The laws have been changed to extend patents to new areas such as life forms, business methods, and software. Copyright duration has been extended from 55 years to 95 years. Perhaps even more important, the laws have become much more friendly to holders of these property claims to tilt legal proceedings in their favor, with courts becoming more patent-friendly and penalties for violations becoming harsher. And, the United States has placed stronger intellectual property (IP) rules at center of every trade agreement negotiated in the last quarter century. 
In this context, it would hardly be surprising if the development of “technology” was causing an upward redistribution of income. The people in a position to profit from stronger IP rules are almost exclusively the highly educated and those at the top end of the income distribution. It is almost definitional that stronger IP rules will result in an upward redistribution of income. 
This upward redistribution could be justified if stronger IP rules led to more rapid productivity growth, thereby benefitting the economy as a whole. However, there is very little evidence to support that claim. Michele Boldrin and David Levine have done considerable research on this topic and generally found the opposite. My own work, using cross-country regressions with standard measures of patent strength, generally found a negative and often significant relationship between patent strength and productivity growth. 
There is also a substantial amount of money at stake. In the case of prescription drugs alone, the United States is on path to spend more than $430 billion in 2016 for drugs that would likely cost one-tenth of this amount in the absence of patent and related protections. While we do need mechanisms for financing innovation and creative work, it is almost certainly the case that patent and copyright monopolies as currently structured are not the most efficient route, even if their negative consequences for distribution are quite evident. 
The structuring of trade and rules on IP are two important ways in which policy has been designed to redistribute income upward over the last four decades. There are many other ways in which the market has been structured to disadvantage those at the middle and bottom of the income distribution, perhaps most notably macroeconomic policies that result in high unemployment. While tax and transfer policies that reduce poverty and inequality may be desirable, we should also be aware of the ways in which policy has been designed to increase inequality. It is much easier to have an economic system that produces more equality rather than one that needlessly generates inequality, which we then try to address with redistributive policies. 0 2 0 0 0 0",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

[Jordan said, “Neil Gorsuch. Jeff Sessions. I mean the cabinet, the executive orders, the travel ban, the things we’re seeing on the federal hiring freeze, the regulatory freeze, and eliminating two regulations for every regulation proposed, I think we’re off to a great start. I think this is exactly what the campaign was about. I think that’s all very positive. ”  Jordan told Breitbart News that confirming Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice and Jeff Sessions as attorney general were his two favorite moments of the last 100 days. He explained: So much of the campaign was about the Supreme Court and the Justice Department becoming so politicized under Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch. Neil Gorsuch I believe was first in his class all the way from kindergarten to high school. I think Gorsuch was an outstanding pick. Those two things show how amazing it is to have Donald Trump in the White House as compared to Hillary Clinton. There’s even been a marked decrease in illegals crossing the border since this administration has been in office and Jeff Session has served as attorney general. Congressman Jordan echoed the sentiments of Congressman Meadows, saying that the House Republicans soon will strike a deal on health care. He said: You know we haven’t passed health care yet, but I’m cautiously optimistic that we’ll get it done in the next week or two. Our chairman Mark Meadows has been working very hard over this break. So I think there’s a chance to get an amendment put in the bill that will result in premiums coming down for a lot of American families. I think that we can get it done in a way that is consistent with what we told voters we’re going to do. Jordan continued, “I think that our jobs are too complicated, the voters sent us to repeal Obamacare, reform a broken tax code that’s not conducive to economic growth. I think that’s the attitude of the White House. My attitude is that we’re off to a good start. I think there’s a chance that we get Obamacare repeal and get that done in the next couple of weeks. That’s what we’ve been trying to do. ” The Ohio congressman supports the president’s initiative to reorganize the federal government and cut down on waste, fraud, and abuse. He said, “I fully support the president and hope that we can help the president restructure and trim down the government. As a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee it should be a big focus, we have a number of Freedom Caucus members to help and support that. ” Jordan summarized his thoughts on Trump’s first 100 days, he said, “Winning beats losing every single time.

0,WELFake Dataset,"(CNN) The Democratic primary race heads west this weekend -- way, way out west.

Democrats will hold presidential contests in Hawaii, Alaska and Washington state on Saturday, three states expected to be friendlier to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders than former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton

But with Clinton leading Sanders by about 300 pledged delegates, and because none of the contests are winner-take-all, Sanders needs stunning wins in each state to give the Clinton campaign any real anxiety about the outcome of the race.

In the run-up to the votes, Sanders has left nothing to chance. His campaign has spent millions on ads in Washington, Alaska and Hawaii, including a powerful television spot featuring Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , who resigned her position with the Democratic National Committee earlier this year to endorse Sanders.

Going into Saturday's contests, Sanders needs to net an estimated 75% of the remaining pledged delegates, while Clinton only needs 35%.

Don't be surprised if Sanders sweeps on Saturday. His campaign has received endorsements from influential players and his campaign has invested in a strong air and ground game in each state.

There are 142 total delegates at stake Saturday, 16 in Alaska, 24 in Hawaii and 101 in Washington.

All three will hold caucuses to choose delegates -- a method that has favored Sanders in the past -- instead of primaries. Alaska and Washington are also largely white and rural, demographics that typically have given Sanders a boost.

If Sanders does as expected, the headlines declaring him a winner thrice over will surely provide a gust of wind for Sanders' campaign for fundraising purposes, even if it doesn't change the calculus of the race.

Delegate math is still on Clinton's side

Clinton heads into the weekend with 1,229 pledged delegates to Sanders' 925, not counting the superdelegates. (The ""magic number"" needed to clinch the nomination is 2,383.)

So even if Sanders posts strong numbers Saturday, he still faces an uphill battle to overcome Clinton's lead. All three states dole out delegates proportionately or by county, so even if Sanders wins a majority in each, Clinton will still nab pledged delegates along the way. And because of the relatively low populations in these states, there simply aren't enough delegates on the table this weekend to make a significant dent.

Looking at the line-up ahead, this could be Sanders' final big night. The next states on the calendar, particularly New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland, where a combined 531 delegates will be up for grabs, look good for Clinton.

Nowhere on Saturday are expectations higher for Sanders than in Washington state.

Sanders has visited the state multiple times throughout his campaign, and the state's liberal urban centers have been especially welcoming of his message of ideological purity over Clinton's pragmatism.

In Seattle, which last year approved a measure to raise the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour over time, support for Sanders is especially strong. The city's largest newspaper, The Seattle Times, endorsed Sanders . He spent the week before the election touring the state, holding six rallies, including a major event at Seattle's Safeco Field the night before the caucuses. His campaign has invested $2.4 million in radio and television advertising in the state, according to Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver.

Sanders is expected to win, but with more than 100 delegates at stake, it will be imperative for him to make that win count by scooping up as many delegates as possible. His results in Washington will help set the tone for the upcoming electoral bouts.

Turnout is anticipated to be high, another factor that aids Sanders. Some 35,000 people have already voted in Washington state using absentee ballots and about 200,000 are likely to participate.

Campaigns on the ground even if candidates aren't

It's not easy to pop in and out of states like Hawaii and Alaska, and with the small number of delegates on the table, the campaigns have largely determined their time is better spent elsewhere. But that doesn't mean they aren't making plays in each using surrogates, ad buys and family visits.

In Alaska, Sanders' wife, Jane, visited Anchorage on Thursday and will remain through Saturday. Sanders' campaign has dropped at least $56,877 on radio and television spots in the state.

Clinton's campaign, meanwhile, has invested in a phone-banking effort in rural parts of Alaska, emphasizing climate change and veteran issues and expressing her opposition to a controversial Alaska mine project, according to The Anchorage Daily News. Clinton called into Alaska radio last Tuesday morning and talked about working briefly in a salmon cannery in Alaska in 1969.

Both campaigns are spending money on ads in Hawaii, although Sanders is outspending Clinton $192,680 to $54,300. Sanders this week touted his endorsement from Gabbard, a popular Hawaii Democratic lawmaker.

How states will dole out delegates

Alaska (16): Delegates will be rewarded by state House districts and determined by a caucus system. Candidates must receive at least 15% of votes in a district to be granted any delegates. The caucuses begin at 10 a.m. local time.

Washington (101): Washington uses a mixed system to appoint delegates from the caucus results by congressional district. Registered voters who attend must publicly attest to being Democrats if they want to participate in the caucuses, which begin at 10 a.m. local time.

Hawaii (25): Hawaii Democrats also hold caucuses, but unlike Alaska and Washington, it is considered a presidential preference poll and conducted by secret ballot.

0,WELFake Dataset,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia s navy rescued almost 100 migrants from a sinking boat off its southeast coast late on Monday, authorities said, hours after eight people being smuggled to Europe drowned in the same stretch of water. The incidents coincided with the launch of joint patrols by the Tunisian and Italian navies to stem migrant flows and carry out search and rescue operations in the area, the Tunisian Defense Ministry said. Tunisia s coast has become the launch pad of choice for traffickers transporting migrants from North Africa across the Mediterranean. Wooden boats packed with migrants, their numbers often swelled by young Tunisians seeking work in Europe, have started landing on secluded Sicilian beaches, often in broad daylight. Activity via Libya, until recently the busiest country of departure on that route, has declined since July as its coast guard and an armed group in the smuggling hub of Sabratha tightened controls. The Tunisian Interior Ministry said late on Monday the coast guard pulled 98 Tunisians, including three children, from the sinking vessel near the island of Kerkennah. Earlier on Monday at least eight people drowned nearby when another boat carrying dozens of migrants collided with a Tunisian navy vessel. Tunisia has won plaudits from abroad for its transition to democracy since 2011, when an uprising toppled autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali.

0,WELFake Dataset,"(Reuters) - Transgender recruits will be able to join the U.S. military as of Jan. 1 after a federal judge on Monday denied a request by President Donald Trump’s administration to enforce his ban on transgender troops while the government appeals an order blocking it. In a ruling, with which the Pentagon said it would comply, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington refused to lift part of her Oct. 30 order stopping the ban from taking effect until the case is resolved, saying it likely violated the U.S. Constitution’s guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law.  The White House said the Justice Department was reviewing its options. The Pentagon said in a statement that it would follow court orders and begin processing transgender applicants on Jan. 1. It added, however, that it and the U.S. Department of Justice “are actively pursuing relief from those court orders in order to allow an ongoing policy review scheduled to be completed before the end of March.”  The administration had argued that the Jan. 1 deadline was problematic because tens of thousands of personnel would have to be trained on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants, and the military was not ready for that. Kollar-Kotelly rejected the concerns, saying preparations for accepting transgender troops were under way during the administration of Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama.  “The directive from the Secretary of Defense requiring the military to prepare to begin allowing accession of transgender individuals was issued on June 30, 2016 - nearly one and a half years ago,” the judge said.  Several transgender service members filed a lawsuit after Trump said in July he would ban transgender people from the military, citing concern over military focus and medical costs. In an August memorandum, Trump gave the military until March 2018 to revert to a policy prohibiting openly transgender individuals from joining the military and authorizing their discharge. The memo also halted the use of government funds for sex-reassignment surgery for active-duty personnel.  Defense Secretary James Mattis had previously delayed a deadline that had been set during the Obama administration to begin enlisting transgender recruits to Jan. 1, which Trump’s ban then put off indefinitely.  The Pentagon said on Monday there were a number of guidelines that would have to be met by the applicants.  It said that sex reassignment or genital reconstruction would be disqualifying factors unless a medical provider certified that a period of 18 months had passed since the most recent surgery, no complications persisted and additional surgeries are not required.  The service members who sued Trump, Mattis and military leaders in August had been serving openly as transgender people in the U.S. Army, Air Force and Coast Guard. They said Trump’s ban discriminated against them based on their sex and transgender status.  In her October ruling, Kollar-Kotelly said the Trump administration’s reasons for the ban “do not appear to be supported by any facts” and cited a military-commissioned study that debunked concerns about military cohesion or healthcare costs.  A federal judge in Maryland also halted the ban in Nov. 21 ruling. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela has arrested the state oil company s boss for the western region and eight other executives at PDVSA, according to an internal company memo and a half-dozen sources in the OPEC member s oil industry.  It was not immediately clear why Gustavo Malave and the other employees were apprehended, though a series of corruption probes are under way at PDVSA and have entangled other employees.  The sources said Malave was arrested on Monday in Zulia state, Venezuela s traditional oil-producing region near Colombia, in what would be one of the highest-profile detentions of a PDVSA executive.  PDVSA, the prosecutor s office, and Malave did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Separately, Venezuela s new chief prosecutor Tarek Saab on Thursday announced he was investigating  spectacular  overpricing in a dozen contracts in the nation s Orinoco oil belt, on the other side of the country.  The reputation of PDVSA - short for Petroleos de Venezuela SA - has been tarnished in recent years by graft investigations involving high-profile staff.  The company has blamed the problems on a small group of employees and executives, and promised a war on corruption. Last year, the opposition-led congress said $11 billion was lost at PDVSA between 2004 and 2014, when Rafael Ramirez was in charge of the company. He denied the allegations. The Caracas-based company is the financial motor of leftist President Nicolas Maduro s government, but is reeling from low oil prices, mismanagement, and lack of investments.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 14:54 UTC © Sergey Kazak / Sputnik Russian strategic missile troops reportedly launched an RS-18 ballistic missile on Tuesday. The launch may have been a test of the advanced hypersonic glider warhead, which would be able to defeat US anti-missile systems. The test was conducted at midday from a site near the town of Yasny, Orenburg region, in the southern Urals, and the warhead reached the Kura test range in Kamchatka in Russia's Far East. ""The test was a success. The warhead was delivered to Kura field,"" the Defense Ministry reported. Popular defense blog MilitaryRussia.ru says the launch was meant to test Russia's hypersonic glider warhead, currently known by its developer designation, 'object 4202', or Aeroballistic Hypersonic Warhead. A select few countries are currently developing the technology. The US has the HTV-2, a device developed by DARPA that has two partially successful tests under its belt. The Chinese warhead using the same technology is called DF-ZF, with Beijing first confirming a test in 2014. India is also studying hypersonic flight technology, but unlike Russia, the US and China, it is reportedly not developing a strategic missile warhead. A hypersonic glider vehicle (HGV) is different from a conventional ballistic missile warhead in that it travels most of the time in the stratosphere rather than in space. It gives an HGV-tipped missile greater range and may give anti-missile systems a shorter window to respond to an attack. More importantly, an HGV can maneuver during the approach to a target at high speed, making interception significantly harder, because it makes guiding an interceptor missile towards the attacking vehicle challenging and potentially impossible with current rocket technology. Object 4202 is reportedly meant to be used with Russia's next-gen heavy strategic missile the RS-28 Sarmat. Military experts estimate that the new ICBM, an image of which was first made public this week, may carry up to three HGVs as payload. A previous possible test of object 4202 was reported in April.",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

Another Facebook poll showing Trump winning 90% of votes, 90,000 comments — look at these comments, stunning — from all over the country. Unbiased poll… I have yet to see Hillary produce ANY Facebook poll where she wins. 
This coincides with the other 500,000 FB comment poll posted on GLP a while back, also showing Trump winning 90% of comments: 


Minnesota’s 8th District – traditionally Democrat working class 
The eighth Congressional District of Minnesota is a working class area in Eastern Minnesota. It has voted for a Democrat in the last four Presidential elections. It has a Democrat Congressman and will likely be the most expensive Congressional race this year. 
Usually, a Democrat Presidential candidate would win. But a recent poll held a shock: 
Donald Trump is up 12 points! 
And more: Trump is winning among women. And the Democrat Party is losing members. They’re becoming Independents. 
What The Data Says did this analysis of the Eighth Congressional District of Minnesota: 
– Trump is beating Hillary by 12 points: “Our poll shows Republican Donald Trump with a 12-point lead over Clinton, 47 percent to 35 percent“ – Trump is winning with women: “leading Clinton 41 percent to 39 percent.” – Dems are crossing over: “the number of Democrats dropped from 34 percent in 2014 to 27 percent in 2016. The number of independents jumped from 31 percent two years ago to 41 percent this year.“

Is the s**t is about to hit the fan? Is the fur about to start flying? Maybe! It’s too early to tell. With a new investigation promised into the true facts behind 9/11, there are already rumors surfacing . . . rumors that certain people in high places are getting a bit worried and thinking about buying one-way tickets to Tel Aviv. WHODUNIT?!? 
Donald Trump’s plans for his first 100 days in office are raising eyebrows around the world, but of all the items on his agenda it is the reopening of the 9/11 investigation that will provide the greatest earthquake for the establishment. 
Trump believes that 9/11 has not been properly investigated and he plans to get to the bottom of it. “First of all, the original 9/11 investigation is a total mess and has to be reopened,” Trump said. 
The election of Donald Trump has rocked the establishment and things are only going to get rockier for them during his first term. There is a reason George W. Bush didn’t vote for Trump in the election, leaving the presidential line blank and voting Republican down-ballot. Trump has pledged to investigate 9/11 in a way it has not been investigated before. 
For the first time 9/11 will be investigated by someone who isn’t part of the establishment, with skin in the game and plenty to lose. 
“First of all, the original 9/11 investigation is a total mess and has to be reopened” Trump announced to supporters. “How do two planes take out three buildings in the same day? I never got my head around the fact that nothing is mentioned about the destruction of Building 7 in the 585 page document,” he explained, talking about World Trade Center 7 which also collapsed – inexplicably – during the September 11 attacks. 
Donald Trump has also taken cracks at former president George W. Bush. There will be no covering up for former presidents on Trump’s watch. 
“The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush,” he said in a February debate. “He kept us safe? That is not safe. That is not safe.” 
“Why did the administration at the time not take legal means against Saudi Arabia? Weren’t 19 of the high-jackers from Saudi Arabia? Americans deserve answers and I will definitely request a new investigation so that this horrible tragedy never happens again.” Donald Trump and the 9/11 Truth movement 
While Trump might be railing against the establishment in reopening the 9/11 investigation, he has received support on this issue from a number of public personalities who have demanded the case be revisited – and not behind closed doors. 
Former Senator Bob Graham has been demanding a new, transparent investigation “For years I have been campaigning for the release of the 2002 Joint Congressional Intelligence Committee 9/11 Inquiry’s report, to no avail” explains the former Governor of Florida. “These missing pages point to the direct involvement of the government of Saudi Arabia. Why are these being kept secret? Who has to gain from these games of secrecy?” he asks. 
“I have read these documents myself and if the American public knew what was in these documents, there would be a revolution tomorrow in the streets of America” he acknowledged during a radio interview. “Americans deserve to know the truth” he concluded, visibly angered by the whole affair. 
Since 2002, the release of a number of 9/11 Commission Report documents is hindered because they are congressional records, hence they are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 
The long withheld 28 pages were partially released to the public this year – heavily redacted – and the Saudi government claimed the release proved they were not responsible for supporting or financing the attacks. But it’s not as simple as that. There are direct ties to the Saudi hierarchy in the 28 pages. There are a lot of questions that need answering, and they were never going to be addressed under a Clinton presidency with all her ties to Saudi Arabia. But with President Trump’s executive powers, everything has changed. The establishment are on edge. More than half the country doesn’t believe the official version of what happened that day. There is now a renewed belief that this biggest of lies and cover ups is about to be dismantled. 
The establishment did all it could to destroy Trump’s election chances. 
Now they are on edge. Like this? Share it now. 3 thoughts on “ TRUMP BOMBSHELL! — I’m reopening 9/11 Investigation ” Gilbert Huntly says:",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

With civil rest or a world war, the administration will be handed the country on a platter – indefinitely – and the election will be a moot point, whether it happened or not. 

From Jeremiah Johnson, SHTFPlan : 
There are a number of excellent pieces circulating that hypothesize on what will happen before, during, and after the election. Mike Adams of Natural News and Dave Hodges of The Common Sense Show have both dug deeply, examining the overall situation with outstanding insights as to the possibilities. Mike’s piece listed the scenarios that can happen regarding either outcome, and government actions that can be triggered by the result. Dave’s videos and telephone conversations expose the fact that the government is indeed preparing to have plans ready and in place with drills and exercises that can turn into an actual operation immediately. 
You can watch Dave Hodge’s full report with Paul Martin below: 
That being mentioned, an article came out the other day written by Deb Riechmann of the Associated Press, October 26 entitled US Official: Russia Might Shoot Down US Aircraft in Syria . The article highlights dialogue from a Charlie Rose interview via CBS at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York that was conducted with National Intelligence Director James Clapper . The answers that Clapper gave to the questions gives two “insights” into the Obama administration’s mindset. This comment came regarding the potential for the US and Russia engaging one another militarily: 
“I wouldn’t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that [it] was threatening to their forces on the ground. Russia has deployed a very advanced and capable air defense system in Syria and would not have done that if it [Russia] wouldn’t use it.”

Then Clapper was questioned about North Korea, and he had this to say: 
“…the U.S. policy of trying to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons is probably futile. Perhaps the only thing the U.S. could get would be limitations on North Korea’s nuclear capabilities. I think the notion of getting the North Koreans to denuclearize is probably a lost cause. They are under siege and they are very paranoid, so the notion of giving up their nuclear capability, whatever it is, is a nonstarter with them.” 
All of this sounds very lackadaisical, coming from the Director of National Intelligence. That is because it is: Obama is pursuing a laissez-faire policy regarding “threats,” either from Russia or North Korea. The reason? He created them to use later. Clapper’s next responses are very interesting regarding the questions of whether or not Russia has been tampering with the election process and the recent threat by Vice President Joe Biden that the U.S. will respond to the (alleged) tampering with a Cyberattack designed “to embarrass and humiliate” the Kremlin. Here is an excerpt of that interview: 
“Clapper also was asked about the Obama administration’s claim that recent hacking of political sites was orchestrated by top Russian officials. The U.S. response might not come in the form of a reciprocal cyberattack on Russia, Clapper said. 
Pressed on the subject, Rose, the interviewer, noted that there is a sense that the Russians were not paying any price for the hacking. 
“Maybe not yet,” Clapper replied. 
“Maybe after the election?” Rose asked. 
“I’m not going to pre-empt,” Clapper said.” 
There we have it, in the absence of verbal commitment, no matter how nebulous the answer may seem. Just because it is nebulous, however, does not belie the nefarious nature of the answer, and it is obvious: The Obama administration is setting the Russians up for the time of the election to blame any deviance or hacks on them. 
It is no secret that election fraud is being committed now, even with the early voting that is occurring in several states. The Cyberattacks conducted on Friday, October 21st were a Beta-test for what is to come: full-blown election fraud and an attack on the infrastructure of the U.S. , to be blamed on Russia or North Korea and used as justification to either suspend the elections or declare them null and void. 
On October 25 , an article was released entitled DMV Computer Outage Raises Fear of Election-Day Cyber Attacks , as presented on losangeles.cbslocal.com . Apparently 100 DMV offices in California had a gigantic computer malfunction that was not attributed to hacking. The article interviewed a USC professor who had the following to say: 
“Election day may be a different story. Government computer systems are vulnerable to cyber attacks. I think there will certainly be some sort of cyber security issue in some location.” 
Clifford Neuman, Director, USC Center for Computer Systems Security 
From a standpoint of greater simplicity, the government can simply collapse the power grid, and this can be blamed on an EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse) weapon from North Korea or Russia. If this is not done, the government can use the Soros-provided voting machines and other nefarious measures (such as dead people’s names being used to vote, illegal aliens casting a ballot, or people voting in numerous states, to name a few) to steal the votes. Then blame can be shifted to the Russians. 
Keep in mind that the Cyberattack on October 21 was found to “not be done by a government’s actions through state actors,” as the Mainstream media termed it. How true. Not one concrete shred of justification that Russia has been conducting any Cyberattacks has been provided. Certainly the Russian government has taken the time to investigate the source of the hacking on the U.S. systems. They will certainly monitor the elections in some manner to protect themselves from any accusations of hacking and prove they do not hold any culpability when the Democrats skew the numbers of the election and steal it themselves. 
This is why the federal government has warned Russia that simply to monitor the elections may warrant criminal charges being brought against the Russian government. 
But it’s OK to have UN election monitors, which in itself is a violation of the 10 th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, right? 
The law doesn’t apply to the Democrats; the law only matters as long as they can inflict it upon you. Soros just came out recently and cursed democracy in general: though toad like in appearance and mannerisms, this communist foreigner is responsible for the collapse and/or debilitation of almost a dozen governments. In a previous article we covered how the voting machines in the early voting in Illinois did not register the original choice of the voter and “chose” the Democratic candidates. This was labeled as a “calibration error,” so simply and innocently. The communists masquerading as Democrats know the truth of the matter, that it is those who count the votes and not the voters who decide the elections. 
In summary, the U.S. is pre-positioning its “enemy-assets” to blame – on what the administration does – for a collapsed election labeled as “rigged” or the suspension of the election for any number of reasons, real or illusory, such as a genuine attack the U.S. provokes or an attack the U.S. carries out on itself . 
Civil unrest and/or war are the escape hatches to bail out of the Constitution and to take control of the country…not letting either crisis go to waste. With civil rest or a world war, the administration will be handed the country on a platter – indefinitely – and the election will be a moot point, whether it happened or not.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON  —   Al Qaeda’s top leadership in Pakistan, badly weakened after a decade of C. I. A. drone strikes, has decided that the terror group’s future lies in Syria and has secretly dispatched more than a dozen of its most seasoned veterans there, according to senior American and European intelligence and counterterrorism officials. The movement of the senior Qaeda jihadists reflects Syria’s growing importance to the terrorist organization and most likely foreshadows an escalation of the group’s bloody rivalry with the Islamic State, Western officials say. The operatives have been told to start the process of creating an alternate headquarters in Syria and lay the groundwork for possibly establishing an emirate through Al Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate, the Nusra Front, to compete with the Islamic State, from which Nusra broke in 2013. This would be a significant shift for Al Qaeda and its affiliate, which have resisted creating an emirate, or formal sovereign state, until they deem conditions on the ground are ready. Such an entity could also pose a heightened terrorist threat to the United States and Europe. Qaeda operatives have moved in and out of Syria for years. Ayman   the group’s supreme leader in Pakistan, dispatched senior jihadists to bolster the Nusra Front in 2013. A year later, Mr. Zawahri sent to Syria a shadowy Qaeda cell called Khorasan that American officials say has been plotting attacks against the West. But establishing a more enduring presence in Syria would present the group with an invaluable opportunity, Western analysts said. A   Qaeda state would not only be within closer striking distance of Europe but also benefit from the recruiting and logistical support of fighters from Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. Mr. Zawahri released his first audio statement in several months in early May, and it seemed to clear the way for the Qaeda figures to use the Nusra Front to form an emirate in Syria with his blessing. Some Nusra leaders, however, oppose the timing of such a move, so the affiliate has not yet taken that step. “The combination of an Al Qaeda emirate and a revitalized Al Qaeda central leadership in northern Syria would represent a confidence boost for the jihadi organization’s global brand,” Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, wrote this month in Foreign Policy. “Al Qaeda would present itself as the smart, methodical and persistent jihadi movement that, in contrast to the Islamic State, had adopted a strategy more aligned with everyday Sunni Muslims,” Mr. Lister wrote. Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have the same ultimate objective to create an Islamic state, but they have used different tactics, Mr. Lister and other scholars said. The Islamic State moved quickly to impose harsh, unilateral control over territory in Iraq and Syria and declare its independence. The Nusra Front has painstakingly sought to build influence over areas it wants to control and with other Syrian rebel groups opposed to the government of President Bashar  . American officials say the Islamic State has largely eclipsed Al Qaeda in the global jihadist hierarchy, with Al Qaeda hemorrhaging members to its more brutal and   rival. Many of the Khorasan operatives, including their leader, Muhsin   have been killed in eight American airstrikes in northwest Syria since September 2014. The Islamic State has between 19, 000 and 25, 000 fighters, roughly divided between Iraq and Syria, American intelligence analysts estimate. The Nusra Front has about 5, 000 to 10, 000 fighters, all in Syria. An emirate would differ from the Islamic State caliphate in the scale of its ambition, in that a Nusra emirate would not claim to be a government for all the world’s Muslims. Some senior American and European intelligence and law enforcement officials say the small but steady movement of important Qaeda operatives and planners to Syria is a desperate dash to a haven situated perilously in the middle of the country’s chaos. These officials say Qaeda operatives in Syria are determined but largely contained. “There’s always been a steady trickle, and it remains,” said Col. Steve Warren, a military spokesman in Baghdad for the   campaign in Iraq and Syria. Nonetheless, the presence of a senior cadre of experienced Qaeda leaders in Syria  —   some with   American bounties on their heads  —   has raised alarms in Washington as well as in the allied capitals of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. “We have destroyed a large part of Al Qaeda,” John O. Brennan, the director of the C. I. A. said this month on NBC’s “Meet the Press. ” “It is not completely eliminated, so we have to stay focused on what it can do. ” The evolving assessment about Al Qaeda and the Nusra Front in Syria comes from interviews with nearly a dozen American and European intelligence and counterterrorism officials and independent analysts, most of whom have been briefed on confidential information gleaned from spies and electronic eavesdropping. They also analyzed the public statements and social media commentary among Qaeda and Nusra Front members. One of the operatives Western intelligence officials are focused most intently on is Saif   a senior member of Al Qaeda’s ruling body, known as the Shura Council, who oversaw the organization immediately after Osama bin Laden was killed by Navy SEALs in Pakistan in 2011. It is unclear whether Mr. Adl is in Syria, North Africa or somewhere else, American intelligence officials said. The government of Iran released Mr. Adl and four other senior members of Al Qaeda early last year as part of a secret prisoner swap with Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen, the group holding an Iranian diplomat, Nour Ahmad Nikbakht. Mr. Adl, a former colonel in the Egyptian military who is believed to be in his 50s, is listed on the F. B. I. ’s Most Wanted Terrorist list and was indicted in the 1998 United States Embassy bombings in East Africa. He is the subject of a $5 million American bounty. “As a senior adviser to Al Qaeda’s networks in Syria and proximate environs,   could be especially useful in helping to define strategies that will help the group achieve   successes,” said Michael S. Smith II of Kronos Advisory, a terrorism research and analysis firm. The other four men released by Iran are also suspected of being in Syria. They are Abdul Khayr   an Egyptian who formerly led Al Qaeda’s foreign relations council Abul Qassam, a Jordanian who was a deputy to Abu Musab   the founder of the organization that later became the Islamic State Sari Shibab, a Jordanian operative and Abu Mohamed   an Egyptian who helped orchestrate Al Qaeda’s major attacks before Sept. 11, 2001, according to American officials briefed on details of the transfer. They agreed to discuss the matter on condition of anonymity because of the issue’s confidential nature. It is unclear how and when Al Qaeda might form an emirate in Syria that would hold territory and most likely harden its position toward more moderate Syrian opposition groups. The Nusra Front was created in 2012 as an offshoot of Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Iraq  —   which under the leadership of Abu Bakr   later declared itself the Islamic State  —   to fight Mr. Assad’s government. That same year, the United States designated the Nusra Front as a terrorist organization. But in 2013, the Nusra Front balked at joining Mr. Baghdadi when he announced the creation of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and instead pledged allegiance to Mr. Zawahri in Pakistan. This ignited an often bloody rivalry between Nusra and Islamic State fighters in Syria. Now Al Qaeda’s top leadership is looking to stanch its losses in Pakistan and score a propaganda coup in Syria by establishing a formal emirate. A portion of Nusra’s leadership, however, supports continuing the group’s more pragmatic strategy of cultivating local support. “The fundamental disagreement is over how far Al Qaeda’s   strategy should be sustained before revealing more and more of Nusra’s real face and solidifying territorial control through the formation of an emirate,” Mr. Lister said in an interview. Many of the Syrian rebel groups that are fighting alongside Nusra against Mr. Assad’s government reject the idea of forming an emirate, fearing it would further splinter the opposition to Mr. Assad. “From Al Qaeda’s religious perspective, the declaration of a state or of an emirate should only happen in a context where it is possible to govern effectively,” said Firas Abi Ali, a senior principal analyst with IHS Country Risk in London. “It would be ironic for Al Qaeda to declare an emirate while there’s a caliphate that it rejects. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Shawn Helton 21st Century WireThe cozy relationship between Goldman Sachs and the Clintons has reached dizzying new heights in recent years, giving the Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton an immensely influential partner on Wall Street.As the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened FBI probe into the Hillary Clinton s email server case   the global investment banking firm Goldman Sachs quietly endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate this past week.The financial ties that bind the Clintons and Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs are nothing new, but never before have the connections been so exposed. Let s take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago   MONEY CHANGERS    Wall Street s Goldman Sachs are inextricably linked to the Clinton s and The Clinton Foundation. (Photo illustration 21WIRE)The Clintons & Goldman Sachs While campaigning for his first term in the White House, former president Bill Clinton received an enormous amount of support from Washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on Wall Street.At the top of the pile sat Goldman Sachs In 1992, the LA Times reported that presidential nominee Bill Clinton, received the largest share of his financial support at least $2.6 million from lawyers and lobbyists,  and that Clinton also received additional support from big securities firms such as Goldman, Sachs & Co. in New York and Stephens Inc. in his hometown of Little Rock, Ark. In fact, Goldman Sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm: $98,700. For decades the Clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth Goldman Sachs and in the process, a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold, something that even the NY Times admits: Over 20-plus years, Goldman provided the Clintons with some of their most influential advisers, millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees, and financial support for the family foundation s charitable programs. By now, there should be little doubt that the Clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wall Street banking cartel. Their relationship was built over three decades.The real watershed moment came here  BLANK CHECK: Bill Clinton laughs with Wall Street elites after signing the Financial Services Modernization Act in 1999. Key to the Kingdom In one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era, the Clinton presidency gave big banks like Goldman Sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely.The Clinton/Goldman Sachs/Wall Street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which banking luminaries cynically named the  Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999  officially titled the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.  The original Glass-Steagall was a depression-age four-part provision under the Bank Act of 1933 that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors   the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the Great Depression (1929-1941). In fact, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which repealed Glass-Steagall, opened the door for the  shadow banking  realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk, as banks became more interlinked.Simply put: Clinton s repeal of Glass-Steagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking   which exposed everyone to toxic, subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite   which ultimately caused the global economy to crash in 2008. All that can be laid at the feet of one William Jefferson Clinton. And Hillary still claims that,  My husband did so well with the economy.  Really?In a cross-posted article featured at Huffington Post, Nomi Prins underscored the complicit nature of Wall Street and Washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the Clinton administration during the 1990 s: To grasp the dangers that the Big Six banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world, you need to understand their history in Washington, starting with the Clinton years of the 1990s. Alliances established then (not exclusively with Democrats, since bankers are bipartisan by nature) enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital. Rest assured of one thing: their past and present CEOs will prove as critical in backing a Hillary Clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husband s years in office. Prins herself was a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, senior managing director at Bear Stearns, as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm Lehman Brothers. Following the financial crash in 2007-2008, Prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled  It Takes a Pillage: Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street.  Prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act since departing from the investment banking world.The media outlet Common Dreams described the merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group (becoming Citigroup), which was dubbed the  Citi-Travelers Act  on Capitol Hill. It was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the Clinton administration s influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of Glass-Steagall: Then, in 1998, in an act of corporate civil disobedience, Citicorp and Travelers Group announced they were merging. Such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the Bank Holding Company Act, but was excused due to a loophole that provided a two-year review period of proposed mergers. The merger was premised on the expectation that Glass-Steagall would be repealed. Citigroup s co-chairs Sandy Weill and John Reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of Congress to make sure a deal was cut. At the time, it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal, as stated by the former Bankers of America CEO Kenneth Guenther. In 1999, after 12 attempts in 25 years,  Congress passed the Financial Services Modernization Act, which led to the repeal of Glass-Steagall.The repeal of Glass-Steagall was pushed heavily by Citigroup s co-CEO Sanford Weill and lobbyist Roger Levy and according to a report by The Nation: They laid out more than $290 million for lobbying in 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and donated more than $150 million in the 1997 98 election cycle a figure sure to be topped in 1999 2000. How much of those contributions made their way to the Clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the White House?In 2005, Bill Clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private Goldman events.In 2013, after stepping down from her position as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at Goldman Sachs events to the tune of $675,000 dollars, in which one attendee said she sounded more like a Goldman Sachs managing director,  according to a quote obtained by Politico. Indeed, Clinton gave a glowing speech to the Goldman gang and in the process, as Wikileaks released in early October, the Democratic nominee believes in  both a public and a private position  on Wall Street reform and that it is an  oversimplification  to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis.That Clinton leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics, but it s only the tip of a much larger iceberg.In 2015, the Washington Post reported that  Hillary Rodham Clinton and former president Bill Clinton earned in excess of $25 million for delivering 104 speeches since the beginning of 2014, a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid.   ANOINTED : Chelsea Clinton with Goldman Sachs-backed hedge funder Marc Mezvinsky.The Clinton family is chock-full of banking connections, as Chelsea Clinton  joined the Avenue Capital Group, which according to reports is a $12 billion hedge fund whose founder has contributed to many Democratic Party campaigns.  Chelsea is married to Marc Mezvinsky, a former investment banker for Goldman Sachs. Chelsea s tenure at Avenue Capital Group was from 2006-2008 just prior to Hillary Clinton s run for president in 2008. Since then Chelsea has risen to vice chairman inside the Clinton Foundation.Marc Mezvinsky was forced to close one of his hedge funds recently, Eaglevale Hellenic Opportunity, after had the fund lost most of its initial investor funds of $25 million   after blowing the money on secondhand junk Greek bank stocks and toxic government debt.The apple doesn t fall far from the tree  As it turns out, Marc is the son of troubled former Congressman Ed Mezvinsky   another close friend of Team Clinton.Politico reports on one of Ed Mezvinsky s financial controversies in 1999:  In the waning days of Clinton s presidency, federal prosecutors and the FBI were bearing down on former Rep. Ed Mezvinsky (D-Iowa), who had fallen for a series of Ponzi schemes and pulled in nearly $10 million money from other investors to cover his losses. Continuing, Politico outlined new information concerning a pardon request sent by from Ed Mezvinsky s wife to then President Bill Clinton: records released last week by the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock and obtained by POLITICO show Mezvinsky and his then-wife   ex-Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky (D-Pa.)   pleaded with the former president for a presidential pardon to head off the looming federal case. In 2016, the Daily Mail reported the following: Chelsea Clinton s husband and his partners have suffered a huge loss after trying to bet on the revival of the Greek economy, and are now being forced to shut down one of their hedge funds.Marc Mezvinsky, 38, and his partners, former Goldman Sachs colleagues Bennett Grau and Mark Mallon, raised $25million from investors to buy up bank stocks and debt from the struggling nation.That fund however has lost 90 percent of its value, investors with direct knowledge of the situation told The New York Times, and will now be closed.

That brought her in close touch with the big Wall Street firms, a source of jobs and tax revenue for New York   and a leading source of campaign funds for Mrs. Clinton. During her years in Congress, employees of Goldman donated in excess of $234,000 to Mrs. Clinton, more than those of any other company except Citigroup, accordingto the Center for Responsive Politics.Along with other New York politicians, Mrs. Clinton worked to obtain federal tax breaks to resuscitate Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and those breaks helped Goldman build its new, roughly $2 billion headquarters. When it broke ground in 2005, Mrs. Clinton and other New York officials were on-site. HOW TO MONETIZE INFLUENCE    Lloyd Blankfein at a Clinton Global Initiative event with Hillary Clinton. (Image Source: sputniknews)The Wall Street RacketTo understand who powers the Clinton Foundation s billion dollar RICO influence-peddling slush fund, you need to understand how money is laundered between Wall Street and Washington DC.Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup and many others were all ordered to pay millions for misleading investors after the 2008 crash, then in April of 2016, Goldman was ordered to settle a federal and state probe for $5 Billion dollars. CNBC reported the following: Goldman Sachs will pay $5 billion to settle federal and state probes into the bank s sale of mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis, the Justice Department announced Monday.Authorities said Goldman misrepresented the quality of loans it securitized and then sold to investors ahead of the housing bubble and 2008 crisis. The settlement includes a $2.4 billion civil penalty, $1.8 billion in relief payouts to underwater homeowners and affected borrowers and $875 million to resolve various other claims.This resolution holds Goldman Sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail,  acting Associate Attorney General Stuart Delery said in a statement. In 2013, a Bloomberg article questioned how Goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the 2007-2008 economic crisis: Whether Goldman could have gone the way of Lehman Brothers or Merrill Lynch remains the subject of much debate. Goldman maintains that it did not need, or want, the $10 billion bailout that Hank Paulson [ former Goldman alum] pushed on it and other firms in October 2008. But the fact remains that when the Federal Reserve allowed Goldman and Morgan Stanley but not Lehman Brothers to become bank holding companies on Sept. 21, 2008, Goldman was able, three days later, to raise $10 billion in equity, $5 billion from the public and another $5 billion from investor Warren Buffett. That would probably not have happened without the Fed s expedited decision and support. (A week later, Morgan Stanley saved itself from bankruptcy when it negotiated a $9 billion equity investment from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.) All told the Clinton friendly investment giant Goldman Sachs (after making record profits) became the fifth mega-bank ordered to pay billions to the Department of Justice after the financial crash of 2007-2008. In addition, the firm was ordered to pay $3 billion to the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2014   not including pending private lawsuits levied on the firm since the Great Recession.In a New York Review article Goldman Sachs was already under investigation for committing fraud at least a year before the economic crash in 2007-2008: Data gathered mostly from the Corporate Research Project, a public interest website, show that on thirteen occasions between 2009 and 2016, Goldman was penalized by US courts or government agencies for fraudulent or deceptive practices that were committed mostly between 2006 and 2009.   CASHING OUT    Bill Clinton with his top economic strategist Robert Rubin. (Image Source: St. Louis Post-Dispatch)Wall Street Selects  Team Clinton The Clinton connection to Goldman Sachs emerged in the early 1990 s as Robert Rubin, a former senior partner with Goldman (with a 26-year tenure with the firm), joined former President Clinton s economic policy team, later becoming Secretary of the Treasury in 1995. Around that time, the Clinton presidency ushered in soaring tax hikes under the  Rubinomics  banner (aka Clintonomics), the plan raised taxes on most Americans, specifically the middle class, in what was said to be the largest increase in American history at the time.According to Congressional record (Vol.146 part 2),  In 1995, the economy grew at a sickly 1.5%   Clinton s vetoes of spending cuts [insured] continued deficits well into the 21st Century. In a Multinational Monitor report entitled  Wall Street s Best Investment: Ten Deregulatory Steps to Financial Meltdown, by Robert Weissman and James Donahue, a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the 1990 s under the Clinton administration was revealed: During the Clinton Administration, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who had run Goldman Sachs, enthusiastically promoted the legislation. In a 1995 testimony before the House Banking Committee, for example, Rubin argued that  the banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago, let alone in 1933.   U.S. banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically. Even domestically, the separation of investment banking and commercial banking envisioned by Glass-Steagall has eroded significantly. With a pedigree that included Goldman Sachs, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), The Brookings Institution and the Bilderberg Group, Robert Rubin emerged in 1999 as the vice chairman at Citigroup (1999-2009) after overseeing its merger as well as helping to craft the repeal of Glass-Steagall while serving as Secretary of Treasury. Rubin made a fortune with Citigroup causing sharp criticism in media and from those within the financial sector following the 2007-2008 crash. Here s a passage from Bloomberg regarding Rubin in the aftermath of the banking collapse: When it collapsed, due in part to bank-friendly policies that Rubin advocated, he made more than $100 million while others lost everything.  You have to view people in a fair light,  says Phil Angelides, co-chair of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, who credits Rubin for much of the Clinton-era prosperity.  But on the other side of the ledger are key acts, such as the deregulation of derivatives, or stopping the Commodities Futures Trading Commission from regulating derivatives, that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster.   SWORN    FBI director James Comey sworn in by former DOJ head Eric Holder. (Image Source: thewhitehousespin)Under the MicroscopeOver the summer 21WIRE observed some curious connections between the Clinton Foundation and FBI director James Comey, as well as his questionable handling of other cases related to the Clinton family. Here s the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the Clinton investigation: Many will also be unaware that before Comey was installed by the Obama Administration as FBI Director, he was on the board of Director at HSBC Bank   a bank implicated in international money laundering, including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels.Forbes also points out where Comey was also at the key choke-point during the case involving dodgy auditor KPMG which followed on by the HSBC criminal case: If Comey, and his boss Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, had made a different decision about KPMG back in 2005, KPMG would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts HSBC and Standard Chartered SCBFF +% were committing on its watch. Bloomberg reported in 2007 that back in June of 2005, Comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether KPMG would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations. In 2015, the Guardian discussed the financial relationship between HSBC and the Clinton Foundation receiving a startling $81 million in donations from clients of the large bank: The charitable foundation run by Hillary Clinton and her family has received as much as $81m from wealthy international donors who were clients of HSBC s controversial Swiss bank.Leaked files from HSBC s Swiss banking division reveal the identities of seven donors to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation with accounts in Geneva. A new update on the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation was announced over the last 24 hours, in addition the recently reopened Clinton email probe from last week. It remains to be seen how in-depth this new investigation will be.To call it collusion would be an understatement. When looking back at the financial affairs of the Clintons, Goldman Sachs and others on Wall Street   it s clearer than ever that what we are looking at is a criminal syndicate.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

However, she s not talking about giving them breaks or handouts or favors, she s proving the case for women entrepreneurs. As much as Wall Street NEEDS to be reined in and made to pay their fair share in taxes as well as be properly regulated, we need to also remember that there can be some good that comes out of companies with a lot of money. Clinton, recognizing this, has been trying to help raise capital to support women in business. Which, in 2014, was looking to raise up to $600 million in support of female entrepreneurs.This video, featuring Hillary making the case for women in business, which was before she decided to run for president, has the caption: The event featured a keynote address from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the business case for empowering women to ensure future economic growth. Pretty evil, right? Probably just another backhanded scheme to  eh, enough of the conspiracy theories.Clinton, during her speech stated: The work that we are doing is work that is absolutely essential for global economic growth. Followed by: There is no path forward that does not include the empowerment of women. As far as speaking fees, her fees were pretty standard for most any highly distinguished speaker, so when she responds with,  that s what they offered  and being a former First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State, it makes sense to pay her as much as they did, as obscene as that amount may seem.Clinton was speaking on behalf of women worldwide and trying to open doors to accessible capital to start businesses and advance gender equity as well as economic equality.Here s her speech in full: Video/Featured image from YouTube",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan filed a criminal complaint against a prominent opposition lawmaker on Tuesday, one of Erdogan s lawyers said, after the deputy called the Turkish leader a fascist dictator. In blistering criticism of Erdogan, the spokesman for the main opposition Republican People s Party, Bulent Tezcan, attacked what he said was a  fearful atmosphere  in Turkey. Erdogan s lawyer, Huseyin Aydin, said on Twitter:  We have filed a legal petition concerning Bulent Tezcan with the Ankara chief prosecutor s office for the crime of insulting the president.  Aydin also posted photos of the petition.  The suspect s statements are part of a new campaign against our president and cannot be interpreted as an isolated incident,  the petition said, saying such a campaign had also been launched ahead of last year s attempted coup. In a speech on Monday in the western city of Tekirdag, criticizing local judicial authorities, Tezcan had said:  If you try to scare people and to create a fearful atmosphere by showing legal words as illegal ones we will not be deterred.  His comments appeared to be in defense of the local mayor, a CHP member, who was questioned by authorities this month after he reportedly called Erdogan a  dictator  at a party congress.  I don t know if our mayor said that or not. I, here in Tekirdag, say it now:  Erdogan is a fascist dictator ,  Tezcan said. His comments prompted a swift backlash from Erdogan s office and lawmakers from his ruling AK Party, with Erdogan s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin saying his  hate speech is an example of disgrace for the main opposition . Insulting the president is a crime punishable by up to four years in prison in Turkey. Lawyers for Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for more than a decade, have filed more than 1,800 cases against people including cartoonists, a former Miss Turkey winner and school children on accusations of insulting him. Following the failed coup of July 15 last year, Erdogan said he would drop outstanding suits, in a one-off gesture. Nonetheless, rights groups and some Western governments have voiced concern that Turkey is sliding toward authoritarianism. Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from their jobs and more than 50,000 jailed pending trial on suspicion of links to the failed coup. Erdogan says such measures are necessary to ensure stability and defend Turkey from multiple security threats. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump sent top U.S. officials to Europe with a familiar warning from Washington that allies must spend more on defense, this time with the ultimatum “or else”. But Europeans have tried to deflect the threats with the argument that a commitment to security is not just about spending targets, which diplomats said that U.S. officials did not challenge, suggesting that the stand-off will continue. “Things look very different if we add up our defense budgets, our development aid budgets and our humanitarian efforts all around the world,” European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told the Munich Security Conference last week. By current standards, Washington funds about 70 percent of NATO spending. Standing beside U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Monday at the Commission, Juncker called for another measure of what counts.  “We want ... a broader understanding that the word ‘stability’ in the world means defense expenditure, human aid and development aid,” said Juncker the EU’s chief executive, adding he was against Europeans being “pushed into” the targets. Allies who do not meet NATO targets to spend 2 percent of GDP on military budgets set out to show Pence and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis how Europeans are dealing with crises they trace back, in part, to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.     “France has a readiness to deploy that is hard to match. Spain was leading NATO’s new spearhead force last year. Italy is in Afghanistan,” said one senior European NATO diplomat. “That isn’t already reflected by spending targets.”  While Germany says Trump has a point about Europe’s drop in defense spending since the fall of the Soviet Union, Berlin and the European Commission also say Washington should take note that the EU is the world’s biggest aid donor, spending some 56 billion euros ($58.99 billion) a year. The United States spends about 1 percent of its federal budget on foreign aid, or about $50 billion, but that also includes running diplomatic missions and giving academic grants, according to the U.S. State Department. The European Union says most of its aid goes to the world’s poorest countries. Germany deserves recognition for the 30 to 40 billion euros  ($32 to $42 billion) it is spending to integrate over a million refugees, many of whom were displaced as a result of failed Western policy, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said. At a NATO summit in Wales in 2014, months after Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, allies agreed to end years of defense cuts that left Europeans without vital capabilities, such as refueling airborne fighter bombers. They agreed all allies should reach the target of spending 2 percent of economic output on defense every year by 2024, although the goal is not legally binding. It aims to reverse a trend that saw defense research spending in the European Union fall by a third, or more than 20 billion euros, since 2006. Only the United States, Britain, Poland, Estonia and Greece met the target in 2016, although the cuts have stopped and Latvia, Lithuania and Romania are close, NATO officials say. NATO’s 22 European allies and Canada will spend almost 4 percent more, or some 10 billion euros, on defense this year and Germany’s increases account for some 20 percent of that. There is no European push to change the NATO target and NATO officials say the 2 percent target will remain politically useful, if not economically viable.  Reaching the 2 percent target could cost NATO’s European members $96 billion per year, according to think tank Bruegel. U.S. governments have been pressing Europeans to increase spending on their armed forces for decades, but Trump signaled a much tougher approach, suggesting on the campaign trail to make U.S. support conditional on meeting NATO commitments.  He has since given his full support to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but complained this month that Europeans have “been very unfair to us”, for not spending more on defense. Pence maintained the pressure at NATO on Monday, telling allies they had until the end of this year to show “real progress” on spending. Pence cited his spending message as one of the successes of his debut Europe trip, diplomats said. Europeans say the biggest issue is how money is spent.  Spurred on by Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, Germany and France are leading plans to build a so-called European Defense Union that would allow countries to develop and share military assets together, as well as deploying troops. Collectively the European Union is the world’s second-biggest military spender. But fears in Britain of an EU army  held back collaboration.  Governments spent in isolation and missed out on savings worth 25 billion euros a year, according to EU data. Trump’s ultimatum is also still “hypothetical”, Pence said.   Asked what if Europeans did not spend more, he said: “I don’t know what the answer is to: ‘or else’. But I know that the patience of the American people will not endure forever.”  ($1 = 0.9493 euros) ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. environmental group the Sierra Club has asked the Environmental Protection Agency’s inspector general to investigate whether the agency’s head, Scott Pruitt, violated internal policies when he said he did not believe carbon dioxide was a major contributor to climate change, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Wednesday. Lawyers for the Sierra Club wrote to the EPA’s Office of Inspector General on Tuesday asking the independent watchdog to check whether Pruitt violated the EPA’s 2012 Scientific Integrity Policy when he told a CNBC interviewer on March 9, “I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.” The request ramps up tension between the U.S. environmental movement and the administration of President Donald Trump, who has called global warming a hoax meant to weaken the U.S. economy and has packed his Cabinet with people who question the science of climate change. An overwhelming majority of scientists think that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels is a major contributor to global climate change, triggering sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms. “It’s pretty unprecedented to have the head of the EPA contradicting basic scientific facts,” Sierra Club Senior Attorney Elena Saxonhouse told Reuters on Wednesday. In the letter, the Sierra Club’s lawyers said Pruitt’s comments contradicted a “comprehensive review” of scientific research on climate change and appeared to be politically motivated. The EPA website says its policy is meant to maintain “a culture of scientific integrity for all its employees,” and requires EPA officials and staff to ensure the agency’s work respects the findings of the broader scientific community. “Administrator Pruitt’s comments are perfectly in keeping with the scientific integrity policy,” EPA spokesman John Konkus said in an email. “There is an ongoing scientific debate on climate change, its causes and its effect. That debate should be encouraged as the Administrator has done, not discouraged as Sierra Club is attempting to do.”  A spokeswoman for the EPA’s inspector general said in an email the IG’s office could neither confirm nor deny investigation requests.    As Oklahoma’s attorney general, Pruitt sued the EPA more than a dozen times while accepting campaign donations from the energy industry. Emails released on Feb. 22 by an Oklahoma Court showed Pruitt also used language provided by an energy company in one of his challenges of the EPA over methane emissions regulations. Sierra Club’s Saxonhouse said the group believed that the EPA’s scientific integrity policy applied to political appointees as well as career EPA staff, but said it was unclear how the agency could enforce it. “It shouldn’t just be a piece of paper or some words on a website. It’s intended to protect the public from bad decision-making that’s not based on real facts,” she said. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON  —   Just moments after the Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act was declared dead, President Trump sought to paint the defeat of his first legislative effort as an   blip. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, was preparing to tell the public that the health care bill was being withdrawn  —   a byproduct, Mr. Trump said, of Democratic partisanship. The president predicted that Democrats would return to him to make a deal in roughly a year. “Look, we got no Democratic votes. We got none, zero,” Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview he initiated with The New York Times. “The good news is they now own health care. They now own Obamacare. ” Mr. Trump insisted that the Affordable Care Act would collapse in the next year, which would then force Democrats to come to the bargaining table for a new bill. “The best thing that can happen is that we let the Democrats, that we let Obamacare continue, they’ll have increases from 50 to 100 percent,” he said. “And when it explodes, they’ll come to me to make a deal. And I’m open to that. ” Although enrollment in the Affordable Care Act declined slightly in the past year, there is no sign that it is collapsing. Its expansion of Medicaid continues to grow. In a later phone interview with The Times, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, ridiculed Mr. Trump’s remarks about Democrats being at fault. “Whenever the president gets in trouble, he points fingers of blame,” Mr. Schumer said. “It’s about time he stopped doing that and started to lead. The Republicans were totally committed to repeal from the   never talked to us once. But now that they realize that repeal can’t work, if they back off repeal, of course we’ll work with them to make it even better. ” Mr. Trump said that “when they come to make a deal,” he would be open and receptive. He singled out the Tuesday Group moderates for praise, calling them “terrific,” an implicit jab at the House Freedom Caucus, which his aides had expressed frustration with during negotiations. Even so, he tried to minimize the deep divisions within his own party that prevented Mr. Ryan from securing passage of the bill, and maintained that they were six to 12 votes away from getting it across the finish line. As Mr. Trump spoke, his voice was flatly calm and slightly hoarse, his manner subdued. He talked on a speaker phone from his desk in the Oval Office, with a coterie of aides drifting by. At one point, he welcomed his daughter Ivanka back from a ski trip. Mr. Trump said that in states he had visited in the last two weeks, Tennessee and Kentucky, the problems with President Barack Obama’s signature legislation were evident. The president said he was now moving on to taxes and trade as priorities. Mr. Trump described his first major legislative experience as not terribly different than what his previous negotiations as a   developer had been like. He emphatically did not fault Mr. Ryan. “I don’t blame him for a thing, I really don’t,” Mr. Trump said. He added: “Even during the midst of negotiations I said the best thing that could happen was just to back off. I said, I’ll do it now because I’m a team player. ” He said that Mr. Ryan did not apologize to him, adding: “Look, he tried. He tried very hard. ” “I’m not disappointed,” he insisted. “If I were, I wouldn’t be calling you. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

Once again, our open borders president and our DHS are in cahoots with Central America in screwing the American people who ll be footing the bill for this. What the local article below doesn t tell you is that the Cubans are being assisted by the feds which only promotes more and more Cubans to come to the U.S. Hey, didn t we just normalize relations with Cuba so things are supposed to be just peachy there now, right? WHY IS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION APPROVING THOUSANDS OF CUBANS TO BE BUSSED INTO AMERICA?Central American nations have agreed to let stranded Cubans be airlifted and then bussed into America. Why not send them home? Well, it s because of yet another stupid policy to accept Cubans who ve made it to dry land from Cuba. Do we really need to keep this stupid policy in place? We re just making it more appealing for more and more Cubans to come to America. Heck, we re even providing transportation for them! Crazy!This is just more lawlessness from the Obama administration thinking nothing of bringing even more people to take care of. Unreal!Central American nations have reached an agreement to allow several thousand Cuban migrants stranded in Costa Rica for over a month to continue their journey towards the United States.The migrants will be airlifted to El Salvador and put on buses, which will take them to the US. American legislation gives Cuban migrants preferential treatment. If they arrive at the US border by land they are allowed to enter the country and apply for residency. Those who are intercepted at sea are sent back, under the special immigration policy known as  wet foot, dry foot .Read more: !00% FED Up!The activity at the Hidalgo International Bridge continues. For 40 years, Jose Angel Rodriguez has made his living driving a cab.He said he s seeing more Cubans crossing the port of entry.  They get here every night, in the morning, and at night they get here. They go to Laredo, too,  Rodriguez said.Rodriguez remembered taking a few to a hotel or store. It gets busier each week that passes by.Down the road from the bridge were a handful of 15-passenger vans. They had Florida license plates. Giovanni Acosta is one of them. In Cuba, there s nothing. There s no freedom. We came from Cuba because the pressure that we have there,  Giovanni Acosta said.Acosta said he s waiting for his wife to come to the bridge so he can take her back to Miami. She s taking the same track as he once did.  I did the same path, like all the Cubans did. I came from Ecuador. I walked for 27 days on the road,  he said.Congressman Henry Cuellar s office said Cuban refugees are coming to Laredo s Point of Entry every day and the numbers are increasing. They re coming from Central America through Mexico to the border.Acosta s van can take more than just his family. He said he can help the Cuban refugees, but his goal is to pick up his family, to bring them safely back home.CHANNEL 5 NEWS spoke to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to see if they were prepared for the influx. They released a statement that said in part,  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is prepared to process the expected increase in Cubans applying for admission at South Texas ports of entry. CBP officers will process Cuban nationals in accordance with established procedures as expeditiously as possible while maintaining requirements and standards for individuals in our care.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Trump has been on a 48-hour freak out with the hosts of MSNBC s  Morning Joe  and his clear incoherence has everyone from mental health experts to average Americans once again concerned that the president is seriously mentally ill. The evidence that our president is indeed mentally unfit for office is circumstantial but persuasive   and Trump keeps digging the hole deeper.Most people would agree that a man who can t stop himself from fabricating a rumor of a bleeding facelift to publicly attack the host of a cable show he doesn t like is unfit for office. In normal times, that alone would be grounds for invoking the 25th Amendment s clause on the president s mental capacity. For Trump, that s only the tip of the iceberg, the latest in a seemingly unending string of incidents that should raise serious concerns.The White House seems to be painfully aware that the questions swirling around his stability are undermining the credibility of his role as president. Consequently, and for the first time in U.S. history, the White House has to run with the narrative that you cannot question the president s mental health. Trump is sane because they say he is sane and shut up about it.Just hours after Trump got into a public fight with the hosts of  Morning Joe  on Twitter while he watched the show live, Kellyanne Conway went on ABC s  Good Morning America  to say it was unpatriotic to ever question whether Trump has lost his mind. Even while he continues to provide evidence that he has had some sort of mental breakdown.After summarizing an (incomplete) list of the things Trump has been called online, Kellyanne said: It doesn t help the American people to have a president covered in this light. I m sorry. It s neither productive nor patriotic. The toxicity is over the top. In short, Kellyanne wants us to believe Trump is the victim in all of this. Meanwhile, he continues to play the part of the bully.Worth remembering: Trump s favorite network, Fox News, once aired Glenn Beck claiming Obama hated white people. Its star anchor, Sean Hannity, repeatedly accused Obama of being a pathological  narcissist.  And its resident mental health  expert,  repeatedly diagnosed both Barack and Michelle Obama with various pathologies, including once saying Michelle needed to lose weight. None of that irrational hatred or vitriol caused Obama to live-tweet a rant about Fox News hosts or personally smear them on social media.But then, Obama wasn t mentally ill, so why would he?Featured image via YouTube",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

He can be seen here embracing parents and families who have been torn apart by the death of a loved one at the hands of an illegal alien:This is the story of a prominent illegal alien activist and drunk driver the Left is embracing and working so hard to keep in America: On May 28, the community organizer for Casa, a national immigrants rights organization based in Maryland, was stopped by police and arrested for a DUI after having had two margaritas at a restaurant. Her blood alcohol was twice the legal limit for driving.Her arrest sent a shockwave through the activist community, with petitions from organizations such as Change.org being filed to stop her deportation.The last thing anyone in the immigrant activist community would have expected was that Wendy Uruchi Contreras would be arrested and potentially deported.Uruchi s attorney, Enid Gonzalez, told Fox News Latino her team filed for a  stay of removal  with the Department of Homeland Security on Friday. Her case is very unusual,  Gonzalez said.  Since she came to the U.S. on a visa waiver    which allows visitors from 38 countries to stay for up to 90 days without a visa    she automatically waived any possible effort to block removal from the country. Gonzalez added,  Had she come in undocumented, she d have a strong defense for cancellation for removal, because of her children. She d meet those requirements. The decision on her stay of removal could take a day or six weeks. If immigration authorities recommend granting it, she ll likely have a year to remain in the U.S., and Gonzalez says immigration officials keep very close tabs on people in those circumstances.Uruchi didn t start her career as an activist very long ago. According to the Washington Post, she met some employees from Casa a few years ago at an event at the Salvadoran Embassy, and she began going to events, then organizing them. In 2014, she was hired full-time as a Virginia community organizer.Uruchi spent the last two years helping undocumented immigrants fight their deportations, without ever revealing her own status.

This is the story of a prominent illegal alien activist and drunk driver the Left is embracing and working so hard to keep in America: On May 28, the community organizer for Casa, a national immigrants rights organization based in Maryland, was stopped by police and arrested for a DUI after having had two margaritas at a restaurant. Her blood alcohol was twice the legal limit for driving. Her arrest sent a shockwave through the activist community, with petitions from organizations such as Change.org being filed to stop her deportation. The last thing anyone in the immigrant activist community would have expected was that Wendy Uruchi Contreras would be arrested and potentially deported. Uruchi's attorney, Enid Gonzalez, told Fox News Latino her team filed for a ""stay of removal"" with the Department of Homeland Security on Friday. Her case is very unusual,"" Gonzalez said. ""Since she came to the U.S. on a visa waiver - which allows visitors from 38 countries to stay for up to 90 days without a visa - she automatically waived any possible effort to block removal from the country. Gonzalez added, ""Had she come in undocumented, she'd have a strong defense for cancellation for removal, because of her children. She'd meet those requirements. The decision on her stay of removal could take a day or six weeks. If immigration authorities recommend granting it, she'll likely have a year to remain in the U.S., and Gonzalez says immigration officials keep very close tabs on people in those circumstances. Uruchi didn't start her career as an activist very long ago. According to the Washington Post, she met some employees from Casa a few years ago at an event at the Salvadoran Embassy, and she began going to events, then organizing them. In 2014, she was hired full-time as a Virginia community organizer. Uruchi spent the last two years helping undocumented immigrants fight their deportations, without ever revealing her own status."

0,WELFake Dataset,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions abruptly asked the remaining 46 chief federal prosecutors left over from the Obama administration to resign on Friday, including Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who had been asked to stay on in November by then President-elect Donald Trump. Although U.S. attorneys are political appointees, and the request from Trump’s Justice Department is part of a routine process, the move came as a surprise. Not every new administration replaces all U.S. attorneys at once.  A Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed the resignation requests included Bharara, whose office handles some of the most critical business and criminal cases passing through the federal judicial system. Bharara met with Trump in Trump Tower on Nov. 30. After, Bharara told reporters the two had a “good meeting” and he had agreed to stay on. On Friday, Bharara was unsure where he stood because he did not know if the person who contacted him about resigning was aware that Trump had asked him to remain in office, according to a source familiar with the matter.  It was not immediately clear if all resignations would ultimately be accepted. A Justice Department spokesman said on Friday Trump had called Dana Boente, acting U.S. deputy attorney general, to decline his resignation.  Trump also called Maryland U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, his pick to take over as deputy attorney general, to keep him in his post, the spokesman said.     Bharara, appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2009, has pursued an aggressive push against corruption in state and city politics and is known for his prosecution of white-collar criminal cases. He also has been overseeing a federal probe into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s fundraising. In November, he announced charges against two defendants in connection with what he called a multimillion-dollar fraud and kickback scheme at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO). He has also brought dozens of successful cases against insider traders, including a $1.8 billion settlement and plea deal in 2013 with hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors LP. His office has secured settlements with companies including General Motors Co (GM.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N); won several convictions and guilty pleas of former employees of Ponzi scheme operator Bernard Madoff; and prosecuted Suleiman Abu Ghaith, a son-in-law of the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Bharara’s priorities have often matched those set by Obama’s Justice Department, which potentially puts him at odds with the Trump administration. Amid an increase in civil rights investigations nationally, for example, Bharara’s office joined a lawsuit that led to a settlement in 2015 aimed at reducing violence in New York City’s Rikers Island jail complex. U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said in a statement that he was “troubled” to learn of the requests for resignations, “particularly that of Preet Bharara.” As Schumer’s chief counsel, Bharara helped lead the investigation of the dismissals of U.S. attorneys in 2006 during the George W. Bush administration. Robert Capers, U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, issued a statement saying he had been asked to resign. He said Bridget Rohde, the chief assistant U.S. attorney in that office, would take over his role in an acting capacity. The Justice Department said on Friday: “Until the new U.S. attorneys are confirmed, the dedicated career prosecutors in our U.S. attorney’s offices will continue the great work of the department in investigating, prosecuting, and deterring the most violent offenders.” ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Videos 15 Civilians Killed In Single US Airstrike Have Been Identified The rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.   Photo of Hellfire missiles being loaded onto a US military Reaper drone in Afghanistan by Staff Sgt. Brian Ferguson/U.S. Air Force. 
The Bureau has been able to identify 15 civilians killed in a single US drone strike in Afghanistan last month – the biggest loss of civilian life in one strike since the attack on the Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital (MSF) last October. 
The US claimed it had conducted a “counter-terrorism” strike against Islamic State (IS) fighters when it hit Nangarhar province with missiles on September 28. But the next day the United Nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed 15 civilians and injured 13 others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elder’s return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. 
The Bureau spoke to a man named Haji Rais who said he was the owner of the house that was targeted. He said 15 people were killed and 19 others injured, and provided their names (listed below). The Bureau was able to independently verify the identities of those who died. 
Rais’ son, a headmaster at a local school, was among them. Another man, Abdul Hakim, lost three of his sons in the attack. 
Rais said he had no involvement with IS and denied US claims that IS members had visited his house before the strike. He said: “I did not even speak to those sort of people on the phone let alone receiving them in my house.” 
The deaths amount to the biggest confirmed loss of civilian life in a single American strike in Afghanistan since the attack on the MSF hospital in Kunduz last October, which killed at least 42 people. 
The Nangarhar strike was not the only US attack to kill civilians in September. The Bureau’s data indicates that as many as 45 civilians and allied soldiers were killed in four American strikes in Afghanistan and Somalia that month. 
On September 18 a pair of strikes killed eight Afghan policemen in Tarinkot, the capital of Urozgan provice. US jets reportedly hit a police checkpoint, killing one officer, before returning to target first responders. The use of this tactic – known as a “double-tap” strike – is controversial because they often hit civilian rescuers. 
The US told the Bureau it had conducted the strike against individuals firing on and posing a threat to Afghan forces. The email did not directly address the allegations of Afghan policemen being killed. 
At the end of the month in Somalia, citizens burnt US flags on the streets of the north-central city of Galcayo after it emerged a drone attack may have unintentionally killed 22 Somali soldiers and civilians. The strike occurred on the same day as the one in Nangarhar. 
In both the Somali and Afghan incidents, the US at first denied that any non-combatants had been killed. It is now investigating both the strikes in Nangarhar and Galcayo. 
The rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.

0,WELFake Dataset,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon marks its independence on Wednesday with its sovereignty as compromised as ever by the agendas of foreign states that have shaped its history since the French mandate ended in 1943. The crisis ignited by Saad al-Hariri s sudden resignation  as prime minister is unprecedented even by the standards of a country where loyalties have been split between countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia regionally and the United States, France and Russia globally. Hariri is due back in Lebanon on Wednesday for the first time since his resignation in a televised broadcast from Riyadh. Many believe Saudi Arabia made him quit and held him in Riyadh because he was not serving its objectives. Riyadh denies this. He will take part in independence day celebrations in Beirut after an intervention by Lebanon s former colonial power France led to him leaving Saudi Arabia for Paris last week.  Can Lebanese people act the way they want? Are they free to take a decision and follow it? No they cannot. Because there are foreign powers who decide the way things go,  said Antoine Mouawad, a 65-year old charity employee.  We do not feel independent,  said George al-Basha, 58, an unemployed barber in Beirut s Achrafiyeh district.  For some Lebanese, the latest chapter in their turbulent history carries echoes of its independence in 1943, when France arrested the president and prime minister. International pressure and popular protests eventually forced their release. The parallel with Hariri s situation was drawn by one of Lebanon s major TV stations at the start of the crisis. Foreign states have often regarded tiny Lebanon as a theater for their rivalry, exploiting the fissures between Muslim and Christian sects who have also courted foreign intervention to help them in their struggles with each other.  For years it was the tussle between Israel, which occupied southern Lebanon from 1982-2000, and Syria, which maintained a big military presence across much of the country from 1976-2005, that played out on Lebanese soil. The Palestine Liberation Organisation also controlled much of the country prior to 1982. Reflecting today s biggest Middle East rivalry, it is competition between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran that lies behind many accusations of foreign meddling. Critics of the heavily armed Lebanese Shi ite group Hezbollah view it as a tool of Iranian policy. Opponents of Hariri, who was thrust into politics by the 2005 assassination of his father, Rafik, have similarly labeled him as an instrument of Saudi policy. But the demand for his return has united Lebanese across the political spectrum. Politicians close to Hariri say Riyadh held him against his will and forced his resignation to bust a coalition government that suited Hezbollah.  Posters of Hariri demanding his return to Lebanon, even in areas dominated by his biggest political opponents, reflect widely felt anger at the perceived foreign intervention.       The most important thing in a country like Lebanon is to understand that independence is a battle that does not stop,  Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk, a member of Hariri s Future Movement, said on Tuesday as he laid a wreath on Rafik Hariri s grave.     Saad al-Hariri has also denied being held by Saudi Arabia, and in his resignation speech instead blamed Iran and Hezbollah for Lebanon s present difficulties.  Wednesday s independence parade will be held near the central Martyrs Square, where reconstruction from Lebanon s 1975-90 civil war continues. In the nearby seaport are moored naval vessels belonging to the U.N. peacekeeping force UNIFIL which was established after Israeli s first invasion in 1978, and expanded after the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah.  What we have seen in the last 10 days or two weeks, this is really crude intervention,  said Sami Atallah of the Lebanese Centre for Policy Studies, a thinktank in Beirut.  When you have a prime minister who resigns in a capital not his own, it tells you that someone else is giving the orders.  Syria s military presence in Lebanon was brought to an end in 2005 by a wave of popular protests and international pressure following the Hariri assassination. A U.N.-backed court has charged five Hezbollah members over the killing. The group denies any role.  Lebanon is tied either to Saudi Arabia or to Iran. It doesn t have the ability to take actions by itself and politicians are to blame for this,  said Nohad Chelhot, a retired business owner. ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan will fail to get foreign support for its cause, the Chinese government said on Wednesday after a Chinese diplomat threatened the self-ruled island with attack, while Taiwan said it was committed to peace. China considers Taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is its main source of arms. Beijing regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue between it and the United States. In September, the U.S. Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. That prompted a senior U.S.-based Chinese diplomat to say last week that China would attack Taiwan the instant any U.S. navy vessel visited the island. Asked about the remarks at a regular news briefing in Beijing, An Fengshan, spokesman for China s policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office, said Taiwan was an internal matter and China opposed any form of military contacts between Taipei and Washington.  What I want to stress and point out is that any relying on foreigners to build oneself up or plots to harm national sovereignty and territorial integrity will be opposed by the entire Chinese nation, and cannot succeed,  An said. China suspects Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who leads the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, wants to declare the island s formal independence. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. The Chinese air force has this year carried out a series of drills near Taiwan, prompting Taiwan to scramble jets to shadow the mainland aircraft. Speaking at a security forum in Taipei, Taiwan Vice President Chen Chien-jen said China had been sending more naval vessels and aircraft through the East China Sea, in addition to its  provocative behaviors  in the South China Sea, where Taiwan is also party to a festering territorial dispute.  Nevertheless, we remain committed to maintaining the status quo of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, but this requires cooperation from both sides,  Chen said.   We are looking for positive dialogue between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and hope it will happen soon. That would benefit the people on both sides, our region and our world.  Since Tsai took office, China has suspended a regular dialogue mechanism with Taiwan and has been slowly siphoning off its remaining diplomatic allies.

0,WELFake Dataset," 21st Century Wire says The mainstream media called it  case closed  after the FBI released its aerial footage of the ambush and shooting of LaVoy Finicum. Now, new evidence reveals that there was likely foul play and a misrepresentation by Federal and State authorities involved in the recent killing of rancher and protester LaVoy Finicum.As 21WIRE reported at the time (although ignored by the Oregonian and other mainstream media outlets) that without any audio track to synch with the FBI s aerial footage, it was impossible to really tell when shots were fired and if the official story was actually true. At the time, FBI Special Agent in Charge, Greg Bretzing, insisted that their footage provided an  honest and unfiltered view  of what happened. However, new evidence tells different story, and appears to demonstrate exactly how the official story was intentionally distorted by authorities   in order to cover-up what really happened that day.At yesterday s Deschutes County Sheriff s Office press conference, officials claimed that the state trooper tactical team members were  justified  in killing Finicum because the officers  feared for their lives.  However, authorities are now saying that the FBI agents involved are now being investigated for firing shots  and never reporting them.Mike Arnold, an attorney representing the Bundys explained on Tuesday,  The public deserved to have the video, with audio and sound, released immediately after the shooting. Now we know why it wasn t released: the public would have heard the shots that the government didn t want it to hear. The following presentation revealed at yesterday s press conference shows previously released FBI aerial footage synched together with a newly released cellphone video from passenger Shauna Cox recorded while inside Finicum s truck. Among other things, this new video proves that police fired first on the vehicle before anyone had even exited the vehicle. Watch: Most importantly, this new evidence reveals what happened immediately after that crash, and this could very well lead to criminal charges against the FBI agents and members of the Oregon State Police tactical units. According to today s Washington Post: Deschutes County Sheriff Shane Nelson said two bullets believed to be fired by FBI agents did not strike Finicum, who was hit by three rounds fired by state troopers. But Nelson announced at a news conference Tuesday that because the FBI agents  did not disclose their shots to investigators, nor did they disclose specific actions they took after the shooting,  his office and the Justice Department would both investigate. The new video, combined with a brand new disclosure by a team of local investigators points towards a conspiracy by agents and members of an  elite national unit  who appear to have lied about events at the police ambush and LaVoy Finicum s death   has now prompted a new investigation by the U.S. Justice Department, led by Inspector General Michael Horowitz.Finicum Shot in the BackAmong other details, newly released findings show that two state troopers shot Finicum three times in the back during the police ambush Jan. 26, 2016. An autopsy revealed that one of the bullets pierced Finicum s heart.Another shocking point of this investigation shows the complete incompetence and negligence on the part of officers positioned in front and behind LaVoy Finicum   creating a dangerous  cross-fire  situation, something which professional officers are taught to avoid, for obvious reasons.Mainstream Yellow JournalismThe mainstream media are still standing by their slanted terminology by describing the incident as a  traffic stop , presumably to downplay the premeditated operation by Federal and State authorities to intercept the two vehicles (both the Oregonian, the Washington Post and many other mainstream media outlets all used this skewed language at the time).Clearly, by any sober estimation of the incident, this was an elaborate, staged ambush involving dozens of vehicles and special tactical teams, and yet every mainstream media news outlet covered the incident with a pro-government bias where the victim was assumed guilty while the government was assumed innocent. Not surprisingly, this coverage quickly turned public opinion against Finicum and anyone else protesting similar issues. One example of the public hate that was generated against Finicum can be found in the comment section of many articles on the website Gawker where Gawker readers celebrated Finicum s death:Tens of thousands of similar hate comments can be found throughout many mainstream media articles and on social media. This fact proves how pivotal the mainstream media s skewed coverage was in turning sections of the population against the protesters in Oregon   despite the fact that Finicum s killing was an obvious ambush and a clear escalation of violence on the part of the government.Stay tuned for more updates at 21WIRE.SEE MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Oregon Standoff Files",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

The survey measures how potential customers feel about a company’s brand and asks if they have “heard anything about the brand in the last two weeks, through advertising, news or word of mouth, was it positive or negative. ” In the week before the company’s January refugees announcement, 30% of respondents said they would consider spending money at Starbucks. But after the statement that number fell to 24 percent, the survey discovered. The company’s announcement immediately sparked a #BoycottStarbucks movement on Twitter and brought condemnation from coast to coast. Not long after Starbucks issued its   refugee statement, many Americans began to wonder why Starbucks is slighting the hiring of Americans  —   especially U. S. military veterans  —   in favor of refugees. Ultimately, on the heels of its refugees announcement, the company felt enough pressure to issue a second statement to explain to America’s military veterans that the company doesn’t actually hate them.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Leave a reply Charles Hugh Smith – Correspondent Bart D. (Australia) captured the entire global economy in three words: The Landfill Economy. Stuff is manufactured, energy is consumed shipping it somewhere, consumers buy it and shortly thereafter it ends up as garbage in the landfill. This is of course the definition of “economic growth”: waste, inefficiency, environmental destruction–none of these matter. Only two things matter: maximize “growth” by any means necessary, and maximize profits by any means necessary. The Landfill Economy now encompasses the entire planet. The swirling gyre of plastic trash the size of Texas between Hawaii and California: it’s just one modest example of the planetary trash dump that “growth” and profit generate as byproducts/blowback. The planet’s oceans are one giant trash dump. Everything from plastic water bottles to abandoned fishing nets to radiation to containers that fell off ships is floating around even the most distant corners of the seas. Seabirds nesting in remote islands die of starvation as their guts fill with plastic bits of “permanent growth.” Globalization has turned the planet’s land masses and rivers into trash dumps.Want to make a quick profit along a tropical sea coast? Dig some big holes near the coast, dump in baby prawns, food and chemicals to suppress algae blooms and diseases and then harvest the prawns to ship to the insatiable markets of the developed world. Once the prawn farms are poisoned wastelands, move on and despoil another coastline elsewhere. Globalization has greased the slippery slope from factory to landfill by enabling the global distribution of defective parts. Whether they are pirated, designed to fail or just the result of slipshod quality control, the flood of defective parts guarantee that the entire assembly they are installed in–stoves, vacuum cleaners, transmissions, electronics, you name it–will soon fail and be shipped directly to the landfill, as repairing stuff is far costlier than buying a new replacement. QE/ZIRP Is Crushing the Global Supply Chain, Product Quality and Profits (October 17, 2016) The Keynesian Cargo Cults that rule global economics love The Landfill Economy because it means more “growth”. Never mind the poisoned seas, rivers and land, or the immense waste of energy, commodities and labor that result from the global manufacture and distribution of shoddy products: if it adds to “growth,” it’s all good in the warped view of the Keynesian Cargo Cults. We got your “growth” right here. People are also tossed on the trash heap with careless abandon. The health of workers is a cost that reduces profits, so it’s ignored unless it can be turned into a profit center via state funding for managing preventable diseases, i.e. sickcare. A worker sickened by industrial waste or lifestyle illnesses who becomes a profit center is a wonderful source of “growth” and profits. A worker who can’t generate a corporation or state a profit is dumped on the trash heap as a matter of routine. A worker who can’t generate somebody a profit or “growth” by taking on more debt to spend spend spend is worthless. If a robot or software can do the same work, then it is self-destructive for an enterprise to pay a human worker: if profits fall, Wall Street will crucify the enterprise and competitors will eat it alive. This “maximizing growth and profits is the highest good” mode of production is insane. It doesn’t have to rule the world. As I outline in my book A Radically Beneficial World: Automation, Technology & Creating Jobs for All , other more efficient, sustainable and humane modes of production are within reach if we escape from the global grip of the destructive “growth by any means” cult.

0,WELFake Dataset,"Josh Fox on Dakota Access Pipeline Standoff: ‘Where the F*** Is Hillary Clinton Right Now?’   CREDIT 
Filmmaker Josh Fox has a pretty good idea where Hillary Clinton is likely to be found starting Jan. 20. But before she makes her final play for the White House, Fox has a pressing question for the Democratic  . 
“Where the fuck is Hillary Clinton right now?” Fox asked during his guest appearance on “Live at Truthdig” at the site’s Los Angeles headquarters. 
That was more of a pointed question than a literal one, since anyone with a television or smartphone can easily track down where Clinton is making her latest campaign stump speech. 
More specifically, Fox, who’s a climate activist and playwright as well as the director of the Oscar-nominated documentary “Gasland,” was wondering why Clinton wasn’t anywhere near the contested grounds of North Dakota where the ongoing clash over the Dakota Access pipeline is reaching a volatile point. 
  
Remarking that “we all want to think that we would be on the right side” of history and that, for example, “if we were in Selma, we all would have marched with King,” Fox positioned Clinton squarely “on the wrong side of history right now” for maintaining a conspicuous silence about the DAPL battle. 
“You cannot stand by when a racist occupying force that is run by the government of a rogue state is operating as an arm of the oil and gas industry, is attacking natives, is attacking protesters, is attacking people and torturing them in the ways that we saw in the Iraq War,” Fox said. “It’s unacceptable.” 
Fox was equally unsparing about Clinton’s environmental credentials. “Hillary Clinton is not an environmentalist,” he said. “Hillary Clinton is not adequate on climate change. And right now, she’s standing by while human rights abuses are unfolding in America where she’s running for president.” 
The director was making the media rounds to drum up support for the activists and members   allied protesters in North Dakota, some of whom faced off Thursday with police in riot gear as law enforcement and National Guard personnel forcibly removed protesters from their encampment near one of the pipeline’s construction zones. He was also putting out the word about the plight of fellow filmmaker Deia Schlosberg, producer of his 2016 documentary “How to Let Go of the World (and Love All the Things Climate Can’t Change),” who was arrested and hit with conspiracy charges earlier this month while shooting footage of activists at a North Dakota tar sands pipeline. Schlosberg has been charged with three felonies and may face 45 years in prison.

“We need to drop all the charges immediately, we need her footage back—her footage was confiscated,” Fox said of Schlosberg. “We definitely need an outcry and an outpouring of support for our journalists who are facing jail time for doing what is a constitutionally protected activity.” Fox has posted a videotaped statement about his colleague’s plight, as well as information about a petition, on this promotional site for his latest work. 
Despite his robust criticism of Clinton, Fox told Truthdig’s Sarah Wesley, Emma Niles and Donald Kaufman that he was more concerned about the possibility of GOP nominee Donald Trump winning this election. Fox, who had supported Democratic candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and served on the Democratic platform committee at last summer’s party convention, said he understood Sanders’ reasons for backing the Democratic ticket: “If Bernie Sanders’ legacy was to contribute to the election of Donald Trump, I think his whole life would have been a failure.” 
As for Green Party   Jill Stein? “I’m sorry. It’s immoral what she’s doing,” Fox said. “And I don’t care if I say this on air for the very first time—I spent eight years building the environmental movement, I spent eight years coast-to-coast building the [anti-]fracking movement, I went to 250 cities. I did not see the Green Party having a significant hand in the building of that movement.”

0,WELFake Dataset," LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California lawmakers, responding to outrage over the six-month jail term given to a former Stanford University swimmer after his conviction for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman, passed legislation on Monday closing a loophole that allowed the sentence.  The bill now goes to Democratic Governor Jerry Brown for his approval. He has not indicated whether he will sign it into law.  Trump hovers over McCain, Rubio senate races U.S. job market 'very close' to full strength: Fed's Fischer North Carolina, Florida brace for brewing tropical storms The measure was introduced in response to the sentence given to 20-year-old Brock Turner by Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky in June, which was widely condemned as too lenient.  Prosecutors had asked that Turner be given six years in state prison. He is scheduled to be released on Friday from jail in Northern California.  “Sexually assaulting an unconscious or intoxicated victim is a terrible crime and our laws need to reflect that,” Democratic Assemblyman Bill Dodd, a co-author of the legislation, said in a written statement following its passage.  Turner was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape, penetration of an intoxicated person and penetration of an unconscious person in the January 2015 attack. Under California law, those charges are not considered rape because they did not involve penile penetration.  The uproar over the sentence, fueled in part by the victim’s harrowing letter in which she detailed the assault in graphic terms, comes amid growing outrage over sexual assault on U.S. college campuses.  “This bill is about more than sentencing, it’s about supporting victims and changing the culture on our college campuses to help prevent future crimes,” Dodd said.  The case has also led to efforts to remove Persky from the bench. Earlier this month, the judge asked for a transfer to civil court.  According to the legislators, current California law calls for a mandatory prison term in cases of rape or sexual assault where force is used, but not when the victim is unconscious or severely intoxicated and thus unable to resist.  The bill, which faced no serious opposition in the Democratic-controlled legislature, would eliminate a judge’s discretion to sentence defendants convicted of such crimes to probation. Under its provisions, Turner would have faced a minimum of three years behind bars.  ",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

[10/31/16] MIKE ADAMS – As America inches toward open revolt over the runaway criminality and collusion of the democrats and the media , another kind of revolt is taking place inside the FBI. According to multiple sources in the independent media — now the only remaining “free press” in America — FBI director James Comey was forced into announcing a reopening of the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server by “livid” FBI agents who threatened to go public if Comey didn’t act. 
James Comey, long since suspected to be a Clinton operative who deliberately allowed Hillary Clinton to get away with a vast number of felony crimes and national security violations, now finds himself with his back against the wall. If he releases the evidence against Hillary Clinton already possessed by the FBI, he will face the wrath of Obama, the Clintons, the corrupt Loretta Lynch (DOJ) and the entire leftist media. If he once again gives Hillary Clinton a free pass on her numerous crimes, he then faces a mutiny inside the FBI which promises to bypass his authority and leak the criminal evidence directly to the alternative media. FBI agents under Comey are desperately trying to save their agency from going down in flames 
Agents inside the FBI, in other words, refuse to allow James Comey to let the agency go down in flames as just another corrupt branch of the “Clinton crime family.” Via the Daily Mail UK : 
James Comey’s decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI , including some of his top deputies, according to a source close to the embattled FBI director. 
This dovetails with my own sources who tell me that the recent acquittal of the Oregon ranchers has also driven a stake through James Comey’s reputation, as he is the FBI official who reportedly ordered the execution of Robert “LaVoy” Finicum, whose suspected execution by FBI agents was caught on tape . 
Because the Oregon ranchers have now been acquitted by a jury, it means FBI head James Comey seems to have ordered the shooting and killing of an innocent man . 
Under Comey — and to the dismay of the many great agents working inside the FBI — Comey may have turned the agency toward a lawless armed tyranny that guns down innocent Americans while letting corrupt criminal politicians go free. For many FBI agents who have spent their entire careers serving the FBI as honest, dedicated federal agents, the thought of allowing James Comey to single-handedly commit political arson and burn down the FBI’s hard-won reputation is just too much to bear. 
Resignations are beginning to pile up on Comey’s desk as livid FBI agents head for the exits… 
Via the Daily Mail: 
“The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldn’t recommend an indictment against Hillary,” said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades… [Comey] told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom. 
“And while the decision to reopen the case may appease FBI agents and republicans, in the short-term, we suspect it does very little to restore overall faith in his competence. As such, we continue to question just how long Comey can hold out before being forced to resign his post,” adds Zero Hedge . “At a bare minimum, in light of his continued questionable judgement and serious doubts raised about the integrity of the first investigation, we fail to understand how an independent investigation into Hillary’s email server isn’t warranted.” James Comey is an arsonist, and he’s going to burn the FBI to the ground unless his agents mutiny 
The upshot of all this is that James Comey is an arsonist. If his own agents don’t force him to apply the law to the Clinton investigations, Comey will burn the agency to the ground, leaving its reputation in ashes. And that, sadly, will make the world a very dangerous place for all the FBI agents in the field, because everyday Americans would begin to see them all as corrupt, lawless tyrants working as part of a criminal regime in Washington that refuses to apply laws to its own kind. 
The truth is that most FBI agents are hard working, professional men and women who are desperately trying to shut down the operations of terrorists, financial fraudsters, kidnappers, murderers and other dangerous criminals. Yet if James Comey doesn’t defend the FBI’s reputation by indicting Hillary Clinton , he will likely be placing FBI field agents in grave danger as they face the wrath of citizens who begin to see them all as part of a corrupt criminal tyranny run by the political mafia in D.C. 
Comey, in other words, is more dangerous to the entire FBI than any other single person in Washington right now. If he doesn’t find his moral compass and guide the FBI through this crisis with law and order intact, he’s going to go down in history (and in flames) as the man who forever destroyed the credibility of the FBI and likely turned his field agents into ready targets for an enraged populace. 
No doubt, he’ll get an extra bonus from Loretta Lynch if he once again decides to nullify the rule of law in America and announce that Hillary won’t be subject to the same laws that would immediately ensnare anyone else. Remember: If Comey gives Hillary Clinton a free pass, he demonstrates to all Americans that lawlessness is now the accepted standard of conduct in Washington . And if our political leaders will not be held to account for their crimes, then practically speaking, why should any citizen feel compelled to follow any federal laws at all? James Comey: If you want to salvage the FBI’s reputation, announce a recommendation for the indictment of both Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch 
If there’s one thing abundantly clear in all this, it’s that both Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch should be behind bars . Clinton is a lifelong criminal and mafia boss. Lynch is a third-rate attorney who was tossed into the DOJ solely because of her gender and skin color, not her credentials. And neither one respects the laws of America, of course. Both are deeply corrupt. 
If the FBI hopes to have any reputation remaining after the Hillary Clinton campaign implodes either before or on November 8th, Comey needs to come out strong right now and lay out the evidence that unambiguously shows Hillary Clinton had CLEAR INTENT to violate national security laws , among other serious crimes. 
All Comey would have to say is something like, “In the view of the FBI, Hillary Clinton is clearly not qualified to serve as Commander in Chief, and we recommend she be indicted for violations of national security…” and so on. With a single sentence, Comey could reinvigorate the FBI and position himself as an historic American hero. 
Right now, I’d imagine the Clinton machine is mailing bloody body parts in tiny wooden coffins to James Comey’s home address, along with notes that say something like, “You’re next.” Let’s watch and see if he grows a spine and refuses to be intimidated.

More than a decade later, the hedge fund,   Capital Management, and its founder, Daniel Och, are paying the price for what the United States government has charged were more than $100 million in bribes paid to government officials in Libya, Chad, Niger, Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo to secure natural resources deals and other investments. OZ Africa Management, a unit of   pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Thursday to one count of conspiracy  —   an unusual violation for a hedge fund of a federal law aimed at preventing bribery of foreign officials. Mr. Och, who is also chief executive of   agreed to pay $2. 2 million to settle a   violation with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Joel M. Frank,  ’s chief financial officer, also agreed to settle charges that executives ignored red flags. And   itself will pay a $413 million fine as part of a   agreement to settle both the criminal and civil charges. The settlement is one of the biggest criminal penalties levied on a United States hedge fund firm, dealing a blow to   as it works to stem withdrawals from its investors, which include state pension funds, endowments and foundations. The court filings by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and securities regulators lay out a complex and elaborate tale of clandestine meetings and dealings with   officials in the regimes of Muammar   in Libya and President Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe. In one instance,   knowingly invested in a Libyan development project in which some members of the Qaddafi family had a financial interest. “Senior executives cannot turn a blind eye to the acts of their employees or agents when they became aware of suspicious transactions with   partners in foreign countries,” said Andrew Ceresney, director of the S. E. C. ’s division of enforcement. The settlement caps a nearly   investigation by the Justice Department, the S. E. C. and overseas financial regulators that last month ensnared the son of a former prime minister of Gabon. But it still leaves the door open for action against others who once worked for   prosecutors said. Michael L. Cohen, who led  ’s investments in Africa, is referred to in court filings without his name being used. Mr. Cohen left the firm in 2013. He was also an officer in Africa Management Ltd. a joint venture set up by   to secure African resource contracts. Mr. Cohen worked closely at   with a former associate, Vanja Baros, who is also referred to in court filings from prosecutors but is not named. A representative for Mr. Baros declined to comment on Thursday. Ronald G. White, Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, said his client had “an unblemished reputation built over the course of a career spent creating value for  ’s investors,” adding that he had “done nothing wrong. ” Mr. Frank also declined to comment. The settlement focuses attention on one of the biggest and   hedge funds and one of the few publicly traded firms in the opaque $3 trillion hedge fund universe. “This has been a deeply disappointing episode,” Mr. Och said in an emailed statement, adding: “This conduct is inconsistent with our core values and not representative of our hundreds of employees worldwide, who are dedicated to serving our clients with the utmost integrity. We have learned from this experience and taken significant steps to strengthen  . ” Between 2007 and 2011,   pushed ahead with deals even though some within the firm raised questions about whom it was dealing with in Africa, according to the government. The S. E. C. for instance, said in its administrative order that Mr. Och and Mr. Frank “were aware of corruption accusations” against one partner it was working with in Congo. But the S. E. C. added that neither Mr. Och nor Mr. Frank knew that bribes would be paid. In another instance, an unidentified employee at   emailed Mr. Och to describe an important meeting with Libyan officials, including one of Qaddafi’s sons, in Vienna in 2007. “Meetings are amazing,” the employee wrote. “They have 77 billion, half in cash and no idea who to give it to,” referring to the Libyan Investment Authority, the country’s   sovereign wealth fund. When Mr. Och later inquired about progress, the employee replied: “I thought you were against it so I haven’t pursued it,” adding that  ’s Libyan fixer wanted to follow up. “You O. K. with that?” the employee asked. Mr. Och replied, “I will be O. K. Will call you. ”   first disclosed the Justice Department’s investigation in 2014. Earlier this year, the firm said it was nearing a settlement with the government, setting aside $200 million for a penalty. In August, federal investigators arrested Samuel Mebiame, a Gabonese consultant and son of a former prime minister, on charges that he routinely paid bribes to officials to secure mineral concessions in Niger, Guinea and Chad on behalf of   and its partners in a joint venture called Africa Management Ltd. The joint venture was seen as a new source of returns for  . A global commodities boom was just starting to fade when the venture was created in 2008, but Africa Management Ltd. had big ambitions to acquire assets like exploratory mining and energy concessions. In a statement at the time, Mr. Och said, “We look forward to working together to grow our combined venture and create the leading investment management business in the region. ” One week before Mr. Mebiame’s arrest,   said it was setting aside another $200 million as a provision for a penalty. On Thursday,   executives  —   including Mr. Och  —   committed to put $400 million toward the penalty. The firm faces more challenges ahead. Investors have pulled more than $5. 5 billion out of the hedge fund this year. “It hurts  ’s reputation,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. “The legal separation of a parent and its subsidiaries might be important in court, but for reputation it is the brand name that counts, and the brand name is in the headlines. ” As part of the settlement,   will hire an independent monitor. The criminal charges will be dismissed if the firm complies with the terms of the   agreement and does not violate any other laws over the next three years. For the    Mr. Och, the deal with the S. E. C. is an admission of a lack of control and oversight at his firm. Like many titans in the hedge fund industry, Mr. Och began his career at Goldman Sachs before going on to found his own firm in 1994 with a $100 million investment from the Ziff brothers, heirs to a magazine empire. For years a top earner in the hedge fund industry, his net worth is estimated to be $2. 7 billion, according to Forbes. He is part of a small group of financial elite who mingle at Manhattan society events, contribute to the same charities and gather at the exclusive World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland. And   once loomed large in the industry. Just over a decade after Mr. Och founded the firm, it became one of the first hedge fund firms to go public, in 2007. With more than $26 billion in assets under management at the time of its public listing,   quickly grew to manage as much as $48 billion last year. According to the firm’s revolving credit facility  —   terms under which the firm can draw from loans  —   if its assets under management drop below $22 billion for more than two consecutive quarters,   could be declared in default.   was charged with four counts of bribery, but the charges will ultimately be dismissed if the firm complies with the terms of the agreement. The penalty that   faces is not the biggest faced by a hedge for breaking the law. Other hedge funds that have faced criminal charges, like Steven A. Cohen’s SAC Capital, have been forced to wind down their hedge funds. Mr. Cohen’s SAC paid $1. 2 billion to federal prosecutors as part of an insider trading guilty plea. Prosecutors and the S. E. C. filed hundreds of pages of documents. At a hearing Thursday afternoon, Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn, noted the extensive nature of the investigation, saying: “I would have you read the charges, but I have dinner plans at 8 p. m. ”",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.

0,WELFake Dataset,"The irony in Obama s radical Treasury Secretary s decision to remove  racist  Andrew Jackson from the $20 bill, lies in the fact that Jackson was the first Democrat to be elected President. Rabid Bernie Sanders supporters are hell-bent on seeing Bernie Sanders fulfill his promise of breaking up the big bank monopolies. Andrew Jackson was pioneer in staving off banking domination in his day.But alas it s official .Moments ago Politico reported that the U.S. Treasury will announce that it plans to replace former President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill with Harriet Tubman, the sources said. There will also be changes to the $5 bill to depict civil rights era leaders.Not every dead president is being scraped however: treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Wednesday will announce a decision to keep Alexander Hamilton on the front of the $10 bill and put leaders of the movement to give women the right to vote on the back of the bill.Lew s decision comes after he announced last summer that he was considering replacing Hamilton on the $10 bill with a woman. The announcement drew swift rebukes from fans of Hamilton, who helped create the Treasury Department and the modern American financial system. Critics immediately suggested Hamilton take Jackson off the $20 bill given the former president s role in moving native Americans off their land.Jackson may remain on the $20 bill in some capacity, but will clearly be demoted.While some pointed to the many accomplishments and qualities of Hamilton for why he should stay on the currency printed by the very Treasury the man created, the more popular argument for the Founding Father s retention was an argument about how awful the man on the $20 dollar bill was.The Daily Beast described Jackson as  villainous  and linked to a February article that called him a  mass murderer. The New York Post argued that Old Hickory  may well have been our most racist president  and was a  vicious, power-mad kook. Lew told POLITICO last July that Treasury was exploring ways to respond to critics.  There are a number of options of how we can resolve this,  Lew said.  We re not taking Alexander Hamilton off our currency. Confused? Disturbed? Angry? You are not alone. The following rant by Mac Slavo expressed many feeling about the proposed change.Andrew Jackson, Who Fought Central Bank, Removed from $20 As  Public Concern for Liberty  ErasedJackson narrowly succeeded in staving off banker domination of the U.S. during his day.Of course, Andrew Jackson, who was the United States  seventh president, was also a complete controversy his entire lifetime. It is no surprise that the same people who took down the Confederate flag from the South on the back of a mass shooting tragedy are now trying to tear down the image of a particularly controversial and intriguing figure from the American past.Jackson was a recalcitrant and unyielding general and war hero, and later an outsider riding a wave of populist support into the White House, bringing in sometimes unscrupulous companions, and plenty of Masons. Many of his backers were diametrically opposed to the entrenched power of New York bankers and speculators, as well as patrician politicians who dominated the first phase of politics in the nation s history. Jackson played a nasty role in the Trail of Tears affairs with Indians, too, and with the South and Western expansion of slave-friendly territories. Many shades of grey.Erasing Andrew Jackson from the faces of the fiat funny-money that is passed around by an increasingly ignorant and dependent society (which itself has adopted digital currency as the new norm) will further cut off the past from the masses, and ensure their enslavement.For entire story: Zero Hedge",US_politics,"Tell me if this is true or false.
